<div class="chapter">

<p>The Studio—The Life Led by Roberto Hasting—Alex
Monzón</p>

</div>

<p>Roberto had got out of bed. Dressed in
his street clothes, seated before a table
heaped with documents, he was writing.</p>

<p>The room was a low-ceiled garret, with a large
window that overlooked a patio. The centre of
the room was occupied by two clay statues with an
inner framework of wire,—two figures of more
than natural size, huge and fantastic, both merely
sketched, as if the artist had been unable to complete
them; they were two giants exhausted by weariness,
with small, clean-shaven heads, sunken chests,
bulging stomachs and long, simian arms. They
seemed crushed by a profound dejection. Before
the wide window extended a sofa covered with
flowered percaline; on the chairs and upon the floor
lay statues half swathed in damp cloths; in one corner
stood a box filled with dry bits of scagliola, and
in a corner, a tub of clay.</p>

<p>From time to time Roberto would glance at a
pocket watch placed upon the table amidst his
papers. Then he would get up and pace for a
while up and down the room. Through the window
he could see tattered, filthy women moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
about in the galleries of the houses across the way;
up from the street rose a deafening racket of cries
from the huckstresses and the peddlers.</p>

<p>Roberto, however, was not at all disturbed by the
continuous din, and after a short while would resume
his seat and continue writing.</p>

<p class="tb">In the meantime Manuel was climbing and descending
every stairway in the neighbourhood, in
search of Roberto Hasting.</p>

<p>Manuel was inspired with the earnest resolution
to change his mode of living; he felt capable now
of embracing an energetic determination and carrying
it through to the end.</p>

<p>His elder sister, who had just married a fireman,
had presented him with a pair of torn trousers that
her husband had discarded, an old jacket and a
frayed muffler. To these she had added a cap of
most absurd shape and colour, a battered derby and
a few vague bits of good advice concerning industriousness,
which, as everyone knows, is the father
of all virtues, just as the horse is the noblest of
animals and idleness the mother of all vice.</p>

<p>It is quite possible—almost certain—that Manuel
would have preferred to these kindly, vague
counsels, this cap of absurd shape and colour, this
old jacket, this frayed muffler and the pair of outworn
trousers, a tiny sum of money, whether in
small change, silver or bills.</p>

<p>Such is youth; it has neither goal nor compass;
ever improvident, it imputes greater value to material
gifts than to spiritual, unable in its utter ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to realize that a coin is spent, a bill is changed,
and both may be lost, while a piece of good advice
may neither be spent nor changed, nor reduced to
small change, possessing furthermore the advantage
that without the slightest expenditure or care it
lasts forever, without mildewing or deteriorating.
Whatever his preferences may have been, Manuel
had to be satisfied with what he got.</p>

<p>With this ballast of good advice and bad clothing,
unable to detect a gleam of light on his way,
Manuel ran over mentally the short list of his
acquaintances, and it occurred to him that of them
all, Roberto Hasting was the only one likely to
help him.</p>

<p>Penetrated with this truth, which to him was of
supreme importance, he went off in quest of his
friend. At the barracks they had not seen him for
some time; Doña Casiana, the proprietress of the
boarding-house, whom Manuel came upon in the
street one day, knew nothing of Roberto’s whereabouts,
and suggested that perhaps the Superman
would be able to tell.</p>

<p>“Does he still live at your place?”</p>

<p>“No. I got tired of his never paying his bills.
I don’t know where he lives; but you can always
find him at the office of <i>El Mundo</i>, a newspaper
over on the Calle de Valverde. There’s a sign on
the balcony.”</p>

<p>Manuel set out for a newspaper office on the
Calle de Valverde and found it at once. He
walked up the steps to the main floor and paused
before a door with a large glass pane, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
were depicted two worlds,—the old and the new.
There was neither bell nor knocker, so Manuel
began to drum with his fingers upon the glass pane,
directly upon the area of the new world, and was
surprised in this selfsame occupation by the Superman,
who had just come from the street.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asked the journalist,
eyeing him from top to toe. “Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“I’m Manuel, Petra’s son. The woman who
worked at the boarding-house. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!... And what do you want?”</p>

<p>“I’d like you to tell me whether you know where
Don Roberto lives. I believe he’s now a writer
for the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“And who is Don Roberto?”</p>

<p>“That blonde chap.... The student who was
a friend of Don Telmo’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that lit’r’y kid?... How should I
know?”</p>

<p>“Not even where he works?”</p>

<p>“I think he is an instructor at Fischer’s academy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where that academy is.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me it’s on the Plaza de Isabel II,”
replied the Superman sullenly, as he opened the
glass door with a latch-key and walked inside.</p>

<p>Manuel hunted up the academy. Here an
attendant informed him that Roberto lived in the
Calle del Espíritu Santo, at number 21 or 23, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
could not say exactly which, on a top floor, where
there was a sculptor’s studio.</p>

<p>Manuel sought out the Calle del Espíritu Santo;
the geography of this section of Madrid was somewhat
hazy to him. It took him a little time to
locate the street, which at this hour was thronged
with people. The market-women, ranged in a row
on both sides of the thoroughfare, cried their kidney-beans
and their tomatoes at the top of their
lungs; the maidservants tripped by in their white
aprons with their baskets on their arms; the dry-goods
clerks, leaning against the shop-doors,
swapped gossip with the pretty cooks; the bakers
threaded their way hurriedly through the maze,
balancing their baskets upon their heads; and the
coming and going of the crowd, the shouting of one
and the other, merged into a medley of deafening
sound and variegated, picturesque spectacle.</p>

<p>Manuel, elbowing his way through the surging
throng and the baskets of tomatoes, asked after
Roberto at the houses that had been indicated; the
janitresses, however, knew no such fellow, and there
was nothing left but to climb to the upper stories
and enquire there.</p>

<p>After several ascents he located the sculptor’s
studio. At the top of a dark, dirty staircase he
stumbled into a passageway where a group of old
women were chatting.</p>

<p>“Don Roberto Hasting? A gentleman who
lives in a sculptor’s studio?”</p>

<p>“It must be that door over there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel opened the door half way, peered in and
discovered Roberto at his writing.</p>

<p>“Hello. Is that you?” greeted Roberto.
“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“I came to see you.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How are you getting along?”</p>

<p>“I’m at the end of my rope.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean,—end of your rope?”</p>

<p>“Out of work.”</p>

<p>“And your uncle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s some time since I left him.”</p>

<p>“How did that happen?”</p>

<p>Manuel recounted his troubles. Then, seeing
that Roberto continued rapidly writing, he grew silent.</p>

<p>“You may go on,” murmured Hasting. “I listen
as I write. I have to finish a certain assignment
by tomorrow, so I must hurry. But I am listening.”</p>

<p>Manuel, despite the invitation, did not go on
with his story. He gazed at the two grotesque, distorted
giants that occupied the middle of the studio,
and was astounded. Roberto, who noticed Manuel’s
stupefaction, asked him, laughing:</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“How should I know. It’s enough to scare anybody.
What’s the meaning of those men?”</p>

<p>“The artist calls them The Exploited. He intends
them to represent the toilers exhausted by
their labour. The theme is hardly apt for Spain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Roberto went on with his writing. Manuel removed
his glance from the two huge figures and inspected
the room. There was nothing sumptuous
about it; it was not even comfortable. It struck
Manuel that the student’s affairs were not progressing
very favourably.</p>

<p>Roberto cast a hurried glance at his watch,
dropped his pen, arose, and strode around the room.
His elegant appearance contrasted with the wretched
furnishings.</p>

<p>“Who told you where I lived?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Someone over at the academy.”</p>

<p>“And who told you where the academy was?”</p>

<p>“The Superman.”</p>

<p>“Ah! The great Langairiños.... And tell me:
how long have you been out of work?”</p>

<p>“A few days.”</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?”</p>

<p>“Whatever turns up.”</p>

<p>“And if nothing turns up?”</p>

<p>“I think something will.”</p>

<p>Roberto smiled banteringly.</p>

<p>“How Spanish that is! Waiting for something
to turn up. Forever waiting.... But, after all,
it’s not your fault. Listen to me. If you can’t find
a place where to sleep during the next few days,
stay here.”</p>

<p>“Fine. Many thanks. And your inheritance,
Don Roberto? How is it coming?”</p>

<p>“Getting along little by little. Within a year
you’ll behold me a rich man.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be happy to see the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“I told you already that I imagined there was a
plot on the part of the priests in this affair. Well,
that’s exactly how the matter stands. Don Fermín
Núñez de Letona, the priest, founded ten chaplaincies
for relations of his bearing the same name.
Knowing this, I inquired about these chaplaincies
at the Bishopric; they knew nothing; several times
I asked for the baptismal certificate of Don Fermín
at Labraz; they told me that no such name
appeared there. So, a month ago, in order to clear
up the matter, I went to Labraz.”</p>

<p>“You left Madrid?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I spent a thousand pesetas. In the situation
I’m now in, you may easily imagine what a
thousand pesetas mean to me. But I didn’t mind
spending them. It was worth it. I went, as I told
you, to Labraz; I saw the baptismal register in the
old church and I discovered a gap in the book between
the years 1759 and 1760. ‘What’s this?’ I
said to myself. I looked; I looked again; there was
no sign of a page having been torn out; the number
of the folios was all in due order, yet the years did
not agree. And do you know what was the matter?
One page was glued to the other. Thereupon I
proceeded to the Seminary of Pamplona and succeeded
in finding a list of the students who attended
toward the end of the XVIIIth century. On that
list is Don Fermín, who signs himself Núñez de
Letona, Labraz (Alava). So that Don Fermín’s
baptismal certificate is on that pasted page.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you have the page unglued?”</p>

<p>“No. Who can tell what would happen then?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I might scare away the game. Let the book stay
there. I have sent my script to London; when the
letters requisitorial arrive, the Tribunal will name
three experts to go to Labraz, and before them in
the presence of the Judge and the Notary, the pages
will be unglued.”</p>

<p>Roberto, as always when he spoke of his fortune,
went into an ecstasy; his imagination opened wonderful
vistas of wealth, luxury, marvellous travels.
In the midst of his enthusiasm and his illusions, however,
the practical man would intrude; he would
glance at his watch, at once calm down, and return to
his writing.</p>

<p>Manuel arose.</p>

<p>“What? Are you leaving?” asked Roberto.</p>

<p>“Yes. What am I going to do here?”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t the price of lunch, take this peseta.
I can’t spare more.”</p>

<p>“And how about you?”</p>

<p>“I eat at one of my pupils’ houses. Listen: if
you come here to sleep, let my companion know beforehand.
He’ll be here in a moment. He hasn’t
got up yet. His name is Alejo Monzón, but they
call him Alex.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Manuel breakfasted on bread and cheese and
within a short while returned to the studio. A
chubby fellow with a thick, black beard, wearing a
white smock, with a pipe in his mouth, was modelling
a nude Venus in plaster.</p>

<p>“Are you Don Alejo?” Manuel asked him.</p>

<p>“Yes. What do you wish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am a friend of Don Roberto’s, and I came
to see him today. I told him I was out of work and
homeless, and he said I might sleep here.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to use the sofa,” replied the man in
the white smock, “for there’s no other bed.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, I’m used to it.”</p>

<p>“So! Have you anything special to do?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you step on to the platform, then;
you can serve as my model. Sit down on this box.
So. Now rest your head on your hand as if you
were thinking of something. Fine. That’s excellent.
Look up a bit higher. That’s it.”</p>

<p>The sculptor sat down, with a single blow of his
fist smashed the Venus that he had been modelling,
and began upon another figure.</p>

<p>Manuel soon grew weary of posing and told Alex,
who said that he might rest.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon a group of the
sculptor’s friends invaded the garret; two of them
rolled up their sleeves and began to heap up clay
on a table; one long-haired fellow sat down upon
the sofa. Shortly afterward a fresh contingent
arrived and they all began to talk at the top of their
voices.</p>

<p>They mentioned and discussed a number of
things, concerning painting, sculpture, plays. Manuel
imagined that they must be important personages.</p>

<p>They had everybody pigeon-holed. So-and-so was
admirable; Such-and-such was detestable; A was a
genius; B, an imbecile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Of a surety they had no use for middle tints and
middle terms; they seemed to be the arbiters of
opinion,—juries and judges over everything.</p>

<p>At nightfall they prepared to leave.</p>

<p>“Are you going out?” asked the sculptor of Manuel.</p>

<p>“I’ll go out for a moment, just to get supper.”</p>

<p>“All right. Here’s the key. I’ll be back around
twelve, and I’ll knock.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Manuel ate another meal of bread and cheese
and then took a stroll through the streets. After
night had fallen he returned to the studio. It was
cold up there,—colder than in the street. He
groped his way to the sofa, stretched himself out
and awaited the sculptor’s return. It was nearly
one when Alex knocked at the door and Manuel
opened for him.</p>

<p>Alex came back in an ugly mood. He went to
his alcove, lighted a candle and began to pace about
the room, talking to himself.</p>

<p>“That idiot of a Santiuste,” Manuel heard him
mutter, “says that not completing a work of art
is a sign of impotence. And he looked at me as
he spoke! But why should I pay any attention to
what that idiot says?”</p>

<p>Since nobody could gave a satisfactory reply to
the sculptor’s query, he continued to measure the
length of the room, bewailing in a loud voice the
stupidity and the enviousness of his comrades.</p>

<p>Then, his fury abated, he took the candle, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it close to the group called The Exploited, and examined
it for a long time minutely. He saw that
Manuel was not asleep, and asked him frankly:</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen anything more colossal than
this?”</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty rare thing,” answered Manuel.</p>

<p>“I should say it is!” replied Alex. “It possesses
the rareness of all works of genius. I don’t know
whether there’s anybody in the world capable of
producing the like. Rodin, maybe. H’m....
Who can say? Where do you think I’d place this
group?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“In a desert. On a pedestal of rough, unadorned,
squared granite. What an effect it would
produce. Hey?”</p>

<p>“I should imagine.”</p>

<p>Alex took Manuel’s astonishment for admiration,
so, with the candle in his hand, he went from one
statue to another, removing the cloths that covered
them and exhibiting them to the boy.</p>

<p>They were horrible, monstrous shapes. Aged
hags huddled together with hanging skin and arms
that reached almost to their ankles: men that looked
like vultures; hunchbacked, deformed children,
some with huge heads, others with diminutive, and
bodies utterly lacking proportion or harmony. Manuel
wondered whether this mysterious fauna might
be some jest of Alex’s; but the sculptor spoke most
enthusiastically of his work and explained why his
figures did not possess the stupid academic correctness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
so highly lauded by imbeciles. They were all
symbols.</p>

<p>After this exhibition of his works Alex sat down
in a chair.</p>

<p>“They don’t let me work,” he exclaimed despondently.
“And it grieves me. Not on my own account.
Don’t imagine that. But for the sake of
art. If Alejo Monzón doesn’t triumph, sculpture
in Europe will go back a century.”</p>

<p>Manuel could not declare the contrary, so he lay
down upon the sofa and went to sleep.</p>

<p>The following day, when Manuel awoke, Roberto
was already dressed with finicky care and was at
his table, writing.</p>

<p>“Are you up so soon?” asked Manuel, in amazement.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to be up with the dawn,” answered
Roberto. “I’m not the kind that waits for things to
turn up. The mountain doesn’t come to me, so I
go to the mountain. There’s no help for it.”</p>

<p>Manuel did not understand very clearly what
Roberto meant with this talk about the mountain;
he stretched his limbs and arose from the sofa.</p>

<p>“Get along,” said Roberto. “Go for a coffee and
toast.”</p>

<p>Manuel went out and was back in a jiffy. They
breakfasted together.</p>

<p>“Do you want anything more?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“No, nothing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you intend to return before night?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have so many things to do?”</p>

<p>“Plenty, I assure you. At about this time, after
having invariably translated ten pages, I go to the
Calle Serrano to give a lesson in English; from there
I take the tram and walk to the end of the Calle de
Mendizábal, return to the heart of the town, go into
the publishing office and correct the proofs of my
translation. I leave at noon, go to my restaurant,
eat, take coffee, write my letters to England and at
three I’m in Fischer’s Academy. At half past four
I go to the Protestant colegio. From six to eight I
stroll around, at nine I have supper, at ten I’m in the
newspaper office and at midnight in bed.”</p>

<p>“What an awful day’s work! But you must be
earning a fortune,” commented Manuel.</p>

<p>“Eighty to ninety duros.”</p>

<p>“And with that income you live here?”</p>

<p>“You have eyes for only the income, not the expenses.
Every month I have to send thirty duros to
my family, so that my mother and sister can exist.
The litigation costs me fifteen to twenty duros per
month, and with the rest I manage to get along.”</p>

<p>Manuel contemplated Roberto with profound admiration.</p>

<p>“Why, my boy,” exclaimed Roberto, “there’s no
help for it if a fellow is to live. And that’s what
you ought to do,—hunt, ask, run around, look high
and low. You’ll find something.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Manuel that even were the promise
of kingship held out to him, he would be unable to
bestir himself so actively, but he kept silence.</p>

<p>He waited for the sculptor to get up and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
exchanged impressions as to life’s difficulties.</p>

<p>“See here. For the present you work for me as
a model,” said Alex, “and we’ll manage to find some
arrangement that will assure us food.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. As you please.”</p>

<p>Alex had credit at the bakery and the grocer’s,
and calculated that Manuel’s board would cost him
less than a model would ask for services. The two
decided to feed upon bread and preserves.</p>

<p>The sculptor was by no means a lazy fellow but
he lacked persistence in his work and was not master
of his art; he was never able to bring his figures to
completion, and noting, as he attacked the details of
the modelling, that the defects stood out more
prominently than ever, he would leave them unfinished.
Then his pride induced in him the belief
that the exact modelling of an arm or a leg was an
unworthy, decadent labor; in which his friends, who
were afflicted with the same impotency of artistic
effort, agreed with him.</p>

<p>Manuel troubled himself little with questions of
art, but often it occurred to him that the sculptor’s
theories, rather than sincere convictions, were
screens behind which to conceal his deficiency.</p>

<p>Alejo would make a portrait or a bust, and they
would say to him: “It doesn’t look like the subject.”
Whereupon he would reply: “That’s a distinctly
minor matter.” And in everything he did it
was the same.</p>

<p>Manuel grew to like these afternoon reunions in
the studio, and he listened attentively to all that
Alex’s friends had to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Two or three were sculptors, others painters and
writers. Not one of them was known. They spent
their time scurrying from one theatre to another,
and from café to café, meeting anywhere at all for
the pleasure of berating their friends. Outside of
this especial theme in which all blended into a perfect
harmony, they discussed other matters with
peaceful digressions. There was a continuous debating
and planning, affirming today, denying tomorrow;
poor Manuel, who possessed no basis for
judgment, was thrown off the track completely. He
could not make out whether they were speaking in
jest or in earnest; every moment he heard them shift
opinions and it shocked him to see how the selfsame
fellow could defend such contradictory ideas.</p>

<p>At times a veiled allusion, a criticism concerning
this one or that, would exasperate the entire conclave
in so violent a manner that every word
quivered with overtones of rage, and beneath the
simplest phrases could be detected the pulse of
hatred, envy, and mortifying, aggressive malice.</p>

<p>In addition to these young men, almost all of
them with venomously sharp tongues, there used to
come to the studio two persons who remained tranquil
and indifferent amidst the furor of the discussions.
One was already somewhat old, serious,
thin; his name was Don Servando Arzubiaga. The
other, of the same age as Alex, was called Santín.
Don Servando, although a man of letters, was devoid
of literary vanity, or, if he possessed any, kept
it so deep down, so subterraneous, that none could
discern it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>He came to the studio for relaxation; with cigarette
between his lips he would listen to the varying
opinions, smiling at the exaggerations and joining
the conversation with some conciliatory word.</p>

<p>Bernardo Santín, the younger of the indifferent
members, did not open his mouth; it was exceedingly
difficult for him to understand how men could battle
like that over a purely literary or artistic question.</p>

<p>Santín was meagre; his face was evenly formed,
his nose thin, his eyes sad, his mustaches blond and
his smile insipid. This man spent his life copying
paintings in the Museo and making them progressively
worse; but ever since he had begun to frequent
Alex’s studio he had lost completely the little
fondness he had for work.</p>

<p>One of his manias was to talk familiarly to everybody.
The third or fourth time he met a person
he was already addressing him with the intimate
pronoun.</p>

<p>Of course, these gatherings in Alex’s studio were
not enough for the bohemians, so that at night they
would come together again in the Café de Lisboa.
Manuel, without being considered one of them, was
tolerated at their meetings, although he was given
neither voice nor vote.</p>

<p>And just because he said nothing he paid all the
more attention to what he heard.</p>

<p>They were almost all of evil instincts and malicious
intent. They felt the necessity of speaking ill
one of the other, of insulting one another, of damaging
one another’s interests through schemes and
treachery, yet at the same time they needed to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
one another and exchange talk. They possessed,
like woman, the need of complicating life with petty
trifles, of living and developing in an atmosphere of
gossip and intrigue.</p>

<p>Roberto mingled in their midst, calm and indifferent;
he paid no attention to their plans or to their
debates.</p>

<p>Manuel seemed to feel that it vexed Roberto to
see him so deeply taken up with the bohemian life,
and in order to enter into his friend’s good graces,
one morning he accompanied Roberto as far as the
house where he gave his English lesson. On the
way he told him that he had made a number of unsuccessful
efforts to find work, and asked what
course to pursue further.</p>

<p>“What? I’ve already told you more than once
what you have to do,” answered Roberto. “Look,
look and keep on looking. Then work your very
head off.”</p>

<p>“But suppose I can’t find a place.”</p>

<p>“There’s always a job if you really mean business.
But you have to mean it. The first thing
you’ve got to learn is to wish with all your might.
You may answer that all you want is to vegetate in
any old way; but you won’t succeed even in that if
you keep hanging around with the loafers who
come to this studio. You’ll sink from a mere idler
to a shameless tramp.”</p>

<p>“But how about them?...”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether or not they’ve ever done
anything wrong; as you will readily understand, that
doesn’t concern me one way or the other. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a man can’t get a real grasp upon anything, when he
lacks will power, heart, lofty sentiments, all ideas of
justice and equity, then he’s capable of anything.
If these fellows had any exceptional talent, they
might be of some use and make a career for themselves.
But they haven’t. On the other hand,
they’ve lost the moral notions of the bourgeois, the
pillars that sustain the life of the ordinary man.
They live as men who possess the ailments and the
vices of genius, but neither the genius’s talent nor
soul; they vegetate in an atmosphere of petty
intrigues, of base trivialities. They are incapable of
carrying anything to completion. There may be a
touch of genius in those monsters of Alex’s, in Santillana’s
poetry; I don’t say there isn’t. But that’s
not enough. A man must carry out what he’s
thought up, what he’s felt, and that takes hard, constant,
daily toil. It’s just like an infant at birth,
and although that comparison is hackneyed, it is exact;
the mother bears it in pain, then feeds it from
her own breast and tends it until it grows up sound
and strong. These fellows want to create a beautiful
work of art at a single stroke and all they do
is talk and talk.”</p>

<p>Roberto paused for breath, and continued more
gently.</p>

<p>“And at that, they have the advantage of being
in touch with things; they know one another, they
know the newspaper men, and believe me, my friend,
the press today is a brutal power. But no, you can’t
get into the newspaper game; you’d require seven
or eight years of preparation, hunting up friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and recommendations. And in the meantime, what
would you earn a living at?”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to be one of them. I realize
well enough that I’m a common workingman.”</p>

<p>“Workingman! Indeed! I only wish you were.
Today you’re nothing more than a loafer who has
yet to become a workingman: a fellow like me,
like all the rest of us who toil for a living. At
present, activity is a genuine effort for you; do something;
repeat what you do until activity becomes
a habit. Convert your static life into a dynamic
one. Don’t you understand? I want to impress
upon you the need of will power.”</p>

<p>Manuel stared at Roberto dispiritedly; they each
spoke a different language.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Señorita Esther Volovitch—A Wedding—Manuel, Photographer’s
Apprentice</p>

</div>

<p>Despite Roberto’s advice, Manuel continued
as he was, neither looking for work
nor occupying himself with anything useful;
posing for Alex and acting as servant to all the
others who forgathered in the studio.</p>

<p>At times, when he remembered Roberto’s advice,
he would wax indignant against him.</p>

<p>“I know well enough,” he would say to himself,
“that I haven’t his push, and that I’m not able to
accomplish the things he can do. But his advice
is all nonsense,—at least, as far as I’m concerned.
‘Have will-power,’ he says to me. But suppose I
haven’t any? ‘Make it.’ It’s as if I were told to
add a palm to my height. Wouldn’t it be better
for me to hunt for a job?”</p>

<p>Manuel began to feel a hatred against Roberto.
He would avoid meeting him alone; it filled him
with rage that, instead of giving him something,
anything at all, Roberto would settle the matter
with a bit of metaphysical advice impossible of
translation into reality.</p>

<p>The bohemians continued their disordered existence,
their everlasting projects, until a gap was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
opened in their midst. Santín was missing. One
day he did not show up at the café, the next he did
not appear at the studio, and in a few weeks he was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Where can that fool be?” they asked one
another.</p>

<p>Nobody knew.</p>

<p>One night Varela, one of the writers, announced
that he had caught sight of Bernardo Santín
sauntering along Recoletos in company of a blonde
girl who looked like an Englishwoman.</p>

<p>“The confounded idiot!” exclaimed one of the
group.</p>

<p>“That’s old stuff,” replied another. “Schopenhauer
said long ago that it’s fools who are most
successful with women.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where he got this Englishwoman.”</p>

<p>“That <i>ingle</i> woman!<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He must have got her
out of his groin!” suggested a callow youth, who
was learning how to write farces.</p>

<p>“Ugh! These cheap jokes are enough to drive
a man to drink!” cried several in chorus.</p>

<p>The talk drifted to other topics. Three days
after this conversation Santín appeared at the café.
He was welcomed with a noisy demonstration,
spoons drumming against saucers. When the ovation
had ended, they besieged him with the
question:</p>

<p>“Who is that Englishwoman?”</p>

<p>“What Englishwoman?”</p>

<p>“That blond girl you’ve been out sporting with!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s my sweetheart; but she’s not English.
She’s Polish. A girl whose acquaintance I made at
the Museo. She gives lessons in French and English.”</p>

<p>“And what’s her name?”</p>

<p>“Esther.”</p>

<p>“A fine article for winter nights,” blurted the
fellow who was learning how to write <i>sainetes</i>.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” queried Bernardo.</p>

<p>“Easy. ’Cause an <i>estera</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> adds to the comfort
of a room.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Out with him! Throw him out!”
rose a general shout.</p>

<p>“Thanks! Many thanks, my dear public,” replied
the joker, unabashed.</p>

<p>Santín told how he had come to know the Polish
girl. They were all more or less filled with envy
of Bernardo’s success, and they set about poisoning
his triumph, insinuating that this Polish miss might
be an adventuress, that perhaps she was in her
fifties, and might have had two or three kids by some
carbineer.... Bernardo, who saw through their
malice, never returned to the café.</p>

<p>Very early one morning, a couple of weeks after
this scene, Manuel was still asleep on the sofa of
the studio, and Roberto, according to his habit, was
at work upon the translation of the ten pages that
constituted his daily stint, when the door of the
studio was flung open and in swept Bernardo.
Manuel awoke at the sound of his steps, but pretended
to be fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“What can this fellow have come for?” he asked
himself.</p>

<p>Bernardo greeted Roberto and began crossing
the studio from one side to the other.</p>

<p>“You’ve come rather early. Anything the matter?”
asked Hasting.</p>

<p>“My boy,” muttered Santín, coming to a sudden
stop, “I’ve got serious news for you.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?”</p>

<p>“I’m getting married.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> getting married!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“To whom?”</p>

<p>“To whom do you suppose? A woman, of
course.”</p>

<p>“I should imagine so. But have you gone mad?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“How are you going to support your wife?”</p>

<p>“Why.... I earn something at my painting!”</p>

<p>“What can you earn! A mere pittance.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you think.... Besides, my sweetheart
gives lessons.”</p>

<p>“And you intend to live off her.... Now I
understand.”</p>

<p>“No, no, sir. I haven’t any intention of making
her work for me. I’m going to open a photographer’s
studio.”</p>

<p>“Photographer’s studio! You! Why, you don’t
know the first thing about it!”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I know nothing, according to you.
Well, there are stupider asses than me in the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
business. I don’t imagine it takes a genius to be a
photographer.”</p>

<p>“No, but it requires a knowledge of photography,
and you haven’t the least idea.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see; you’ll see whether I have or
not.”</p>

<p>“Besides, it takes money.”</p>

<p>“I have the money.”</p>

<p>“Who gave it to you?”</p>

<p>“A certain party.”</p>

<p>“Lucky boy!”</p>

<p>“You’ll see.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager you wheedled the money out of your
sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Bah! None of your lying.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, no.”</p>

<p>“And I say, yes. Who else would give you the
money? Any other person would first have investigated
just how much you knew about photography
and learned whether you ever worked in a
studio; they would require proof of your ability.
Only a woman could believe blindly, simply taking
a fellow’s word for it.”</p>

<p>“It’s a woman who’s lending me the money, but
it isn’t my sweetheart.”</p>

<p>“Come. None of your lies, now. I can’t believe
that you’ve come here just to tell me a string of
whoppers.”</p>

<p>Roberto, who had interrupted his writing, now
resumed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Bernardo made no reply and began to pace up
and down the room anew.</p>

<p>“Have you much work left?” he asked suddenly,
coming to a stop.</p>

<p>“Two pages. If you’ve got anything to say to
me, I’m listening.”</p>

<p>“Well, see here, it’s this way. The money really
does come from my sweetheart. She offered it to
me. ‘What can we do with this?’ she said to me.
And it occurred to me to open up a photographer’s
studio. I’ve hired a place on a fourth floor, with
a very attractive workroom, in the Calle de Luchana,
and I have to put the suite and the gallery in order....
And, to tell the truth, I don’t know just how
to arrange the gallery, for there are curtains to
be put up.... But I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather rare in a photographer,—not to
know how to arrange a gallery.”</p>

<p>“I know how to work the camera.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. You know exactly as much as everybody
else: aim, press the bulb, and as for the rest
... let somebody else attend to it.”</p>

<p>“No, I know the rest, too.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how to develop a plate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I imagine I could.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“How?... Why, I’d look it up in a manual.”</p>

<p>“What a photographer! You’re deceiving your
sweetheart most shamefully.”</p>

<p>“She wanted it. I may know nothing now, but
I’ll learn. What I’d like you to do is write a couple
of lines to these German firms that I’ve noted down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
here, asking for catalogues of cameras and other
photographic apparatus. And then I’d like you to
step in to my house, for, with all your talent, you
can give me an idea of things.”</p>

<p>“You flatter me most indecently.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s the plain truth. You understand these
matters. You’ll come, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll come some day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do. Take my word for it, I really want
to settle down to business and work, so that my
poor father may be able to live a peaceful old age.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to talk.”</p>

<p>“And there’s another thing. This youngster that
you keep here,—does he work for you?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I could take him into my house and
he might learn the profession there.”</p>

<p>“Now that strikes me as pretty sensible, too.
Take him along.”</p>

<p>“Will Alex be willing?”</p>

<p>“If the boy is.”</p>

<p>“Will you speak to him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. This very moment.”</p>

<p>“And can I count on your writing those letters?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll be off now, for I have to buy some
glass panes. Speak to the boy.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me.”</p>

<p>“Thanks for everything. And you’ll drop in to
my house, won’t you? Remember, my future and
my father’s depend on it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Bernardo pressed the hands of his friend effusively
and left. Roberto, when he had finished
writing, called: “Manuel.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You were awake, weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You heard our conversation?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re willing, you know what you can
do. You have a chance to learn a profession.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go, if you think it best.”</p>

<p>“It’s up to you.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go this very moment.”</p>

<p>Without bidding good-bye to Alex, Manuel left
the garret and went off to the Calle de Luchana
in search of Bernardo Santín. The apartment was
nominally on the third floor, but counting the mezzanine
and the ground floor, it was really on the
fifth. In response to Manuel’s knocking an aged
man with reddish eyes opened the door; it was
Bernardo’s father. Manuel explained the purpose
of his coming, and the old man shrugged his shoulders,
and returned to the kitchen, where he was
cooking. Manuel waited for Bernardo to arrive.
The house was still without any furniture; there
was only a table and a few pots and pans in the
kitchen, and two beds in a large room. Bernardo
arrived, and the three had lunch and Santín decided
that Manuel should ask the janitor for a step-ladder
and get busy arranging and inserting the panes of
glass in the gallery.</p>

<p>After having given these orders he said that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
must be off at once to an appointment, and
left.</p>

<p>Manuel spent the first day at the top of a ladder,
putting the panes into place with bands of lead
and gluing the broken ones together with strips of
paper.</p>

<p>Arranging the panes was a matter of much time;
then Manuel put up the curtains and papered the
gallery with rolls of blue printing paper.</p>

<p>Within a week or thereabouts Roberto appeared
with the catalogues. He marked with a pencil the
things that they would have to order, and instructed
Bernardo in the arrangement of the dark room; he
indicated a spot best adapted to the installment of
a transom, where the plates would be exposed to
the sun and the positives made, and informed him
upon a number of other details. Bernardo paid
close attention to all Roberto said and then handed
over all the duties to Manuel. Bernardo, besides
possessing little intelligence, was an inveterate idler.
He did absolutely nothing. Only when his sweetheart
came to see how matters were progressing
would he pretend to be very busy.</p>

<p>His sweetheart was a very winsome creature; she
seemed to Manuel even pretty, despite her red hair
and her lashes and eyebrows of the same colour.
She had a pale little face, somewhat freckled, a
pinkish, turned-up nose, clear eyes and lips so red
and alluring that they roused a desire to kiss them.
She was of diminutive build, but very well formed.
She did not trill her r’s, gliding over them, and
pronounced her c’s before e and i as <i>s</i> instead of <i>th</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed to be genuinely in love with Bernardo,
and this shocked Manuel.</p>

<p>“She can’t really know him,” he thought.</p>

<p>Bernardo, with an unlimited conviction of his
own knowledge, explained to the girl all the work
he was doing and how he was going to arrange the
laboratory. Whatever he had heard from Roberto
he spouted forth to his sweetheart with the most
unheard-of impudence. The girl found everything
sailing along very nicely; doubtless she foresaw a
rosy future.</p>

<p>Manuel, who saw through the swindle that Bernardo
was perpetrating, wondered whether it would
not be an act of charity to inform the blonde miss
that her sweetheart was a good-for-nothing mountebank.
But, after all, what business was it of
his?</p>

<p>Bernardo now led a grand existence; he loitered,
he bought jewelry on the instalment plan, he gambled
at the Frontón Central. All he did in the house
was issue contradictory orders and get matters into
a hopeless tangle. In the meantime his father
cooked away in the kitchen, indifferent to everything,
and spent the day pounding in the mortar or
mincing meat in the chopping bowl.</p>

<p>Manuel would go to bed so exhausted that he
fell asleep at once; but one night, when he had not
sunk into slumber so soon he heard Bernardo, from
the next room, declare:</p>

<p>“I’m going to kill you.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to kill him?” asked the voice of the
red-eyed old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take your time,” replied the son. “You made
me lose my place.”</p>

<p>And he began his reading over again, for that
was all it was, until he came once more to the
sentence, “I’m going to kill you.” On the following
nights Bernardo continued his reading, in terrible
tones. This, without a doubt, was his sole occupation.</p>

<p>Bernardo was no more worried about things than
was his father; all the rest was utterly indifferent
in his eyes; he had wheedled the money out of his
sweetheart and was now living on it, squandering it
as if it were his own. When the camera and other
apparatus arrived from Germany, at first he entertained
himself by printing positives from plates
that Roberto had developed. Soon, however, he
wearied of this and did nothing at all.</p>

<p>He was stupid and base beyond belief; he committed
one absurdity after the other. He would
open the camera while the plates were being exposed,
and confuse the various bottles of fluid. It
exasperated Roberto to see how utterly careless the
man could be.</p>

<p>In the meantime preparations were proceeding
for the wedding. Several times Manuel and Bernardo
went to the Rastro and bought photographs
of actresses made in Paris by Reutlinger, unglued
the picture from the mounting and pasted it upon
other mountings that bore the signature <i>Bernardo
Santín, Photographer</i>, printed along the margin in
gilt letters.</p>

<p>The wedding took place in November, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Chamberí church. Roberto did not care to attend,
but Bernardo himself went to fetch him and there
was nothing to do but take part in the celebration.
After the ceremony they went for a spread to a
café on the Glorieta de Bildao.</p>

<p>The guests were: two friends of the groom’s
father, one of them a retired soldier; the landlady
of the house in which the bride had been living,
and her daughter; a cousin of Bernardo’s, his wife,
and Manuel.</p>

<p>Roberto engaged in conversation with the bride,
who struck him as being very personable and agreeable;
she spoke English quite well, and they exchanged
a few words in that tongue.</p>

<p>“Too bad she’s marrying such a dolt,” thought
Roberto.</p>

<p>At the banquet one of the old men began to
tell a number of smutty tales that brought blushes
to the bride’s cheek. Bernardo, who had drunk
too freely, jested with his cousin’s wife with that
coarseness and gracelessness which characterized
him.</p>

<p>The return from the ceremony to the house in
the evening, was gloomy. Bernardo was in high
feather and tried to play the elegant gentleman.
Esther spoke to Roberto about her departed
mother, and the solitude in which she dwelt.</p>

<p>On reaching the entrance to the house, the guests
took leave of the couple. As Roberto was about
to go, Bernardo came up to him and, in a lifeless,
scarcely audible voice, confessed that he was afraid
to remain alone with his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“Man, don’t be an idiot. What did you get
married for, then?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what I was doing. Come, stay
with me a moment.”</p>

<p>“What! A pleasant joke on your wife that
would be!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s fond of you.”</p>

<p>Roberto scrutinized his friend, avoiding his eyes,
because he had no relish for jests.</p>

<p>“Yes, do stay with me. There’s something else,
too.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know a thing yet about photography,
and I’d like you to come for a week or two. I beg
it as a special favour.”</p>

<p>“It’s impossible. I have my lessons to give.”</p>

<p>“Come, if only during the lunch hour. You’ll
eat with us.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“And now, come up for a moment, do.”</p>

<p>“No, not now.” Roberto turned and left.</p>

<p>During the succeeding days Roberto visited the
newly married couple, and chatted with them during
the meal.</p>

<p>On the third day, between Bernardo and Manuel,
they managed to photograph two servant girls who
appeared at the studio. Roberto developed the
plates, which, as luck would have it, came out well,
and he continued visiting his friend’s home.</p>

<p>Bernardo resumed the life of his bachelor days,
devoting himself to loafing and amusement. After
a few days he failed to show up for lunch. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
absolutely without a glimmer of moral sentiment;
he had noticed that his wife and Roberto had a liking
for one another, and he imagined that Roberto,
in order to be near the place and make love to his
wife, would do the work in his stead. Provided
that his father and he lived well, the rest did not
matter to him.</p>

<p>When Roberto realized the scheme, he grew
indignant.</p>

<p>“See here, listen to me,” he said. “Do you
imagine I’m going to work here for you while you
go idling around? Not a bit of it, my dear
fellow!”</p>

<p>“I’m no good for working with these nasty
chemicals,” replied Bernardo, sullenly. “I’m an
artist.”</p>

<p>“What you are is a good-for-nothing imbecile.”</p>

<p>“Excellent. All the better.”</p>

<p>“You’re utterly worthless. You married this
girl just to get the little money she had. It’s disgusting.”</p>

<p>“I know well enough you’ll take my wife’s
part.”</p>

<p>“I’m not taking her part. The poor thing was
idiotic enough herself to have married the like of
you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean, then, that you don’t care to come
here and do the work?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do not.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all the same to me. I’ve found a
business partner. So you may as well know. I
don’t beg anybody to come to my house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Roberto stopped coming. In a few days the
partner presented himself and Bernardo discharged
Manuel.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The “Europea” and the “Benefactora”—A Strange Employment</p>

</div>

<p>Manuel returned to Alex’s studio. That
worthy, displeased with the boy because
he had left the place without so much as
saying good-bye, refused to allow him to stay there
again.</p>

<p>The bohemians who forgathered at the studio
asked how Bernardo was getting along, and uttered
a string of humorous commentaries upon the lot
that Fate held in store for the photographer.</p>

<p>“So Roberto developed his plates?” asked one.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“He retouched his plates and his wife,” added
another.</p>

<p>“What a shameless wretch that Bernardo is!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. He’s a philosopher of Candide’s
school. Be a cuckold and cultivate your garden.
There lies true happiness.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do now?” asked
Alex sarcastically of Manuel.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I’ll look for employment.”</p>

<p>“See here, do you fellows know a man by the
name of Señor Don Bonifacio Mingote, who lives
on the third floor of this house?” asked Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Servando Arzubiaga, the thin, indifferent gentleman.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He’s an employment agent. He can’t have very
good jobs on his list, or he’d have got himself one.
I know him through the newspaper; he was formerly
the representative for certain mineral waters and
used to bring advertisements. He was telling me
the other day that he needed a young fellow.”</p>

<p>“Better go see him,” advised Alex.</p>

<p>“You don’t aspire to be a grandee of Spain, do
you?” asked Don Servando of Manuel, with a smile
blended of irony and kindliness.</p>

<p>“No, nor you, either,” retorted Manuel, ill-humouredly.</p>

<p>Don Servando burst into laughter.</p>

<p>“If you’re willing, we’ll see this Mingote. Shall
we go this very moment?”</p>

<p>“Come along, if you wish.”</p>

<p>They went down to the third floor, knocked at
a door, and were bidden into a narrow dining-room.
They asked for the agent and a slovenly servant-girl
pointed to a door. Don Servando rapped with
his knuckles, and in response to a “Come in!” from
some one inside, they both entered the room.</p>

<p>A corpulent man with thick, dyed moustaches,
wrapped in a woman’s cloak, was pacing up and
down, declaiming and gesticulating with a cane in
his right hand. He stopped, and opening wide his
arms, in theatrical tones exclaimed: “Ah, my
dear Señor Don Servando! Welcome, welcome!”
Then he gazed at the ceiling, and in the same
affected manner, added: “What brings to this poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
habitation at such an early hour the illustrious
writer, the inveterate night-owl?”</p>

<p>Don Servando related to the corpulent gentleman,
who was none other than Don Bonifacio
Mingote himself, the reasons for his visit.</p>

<p>In the meantime an ugly creature, filthy and
sickly, with arms like a doll’s and the head of a
Chinaman, stuck his pen behind his ear and began
to rub his palms with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The room was ill-smelling, cluttered with torn
posters, large and small, which were pasted to the
wall; in a corner stood a narrow bed, in disarray;
there were three disembowelled chairs with the
horse-hair stuffing exposed; in the middle, a brazier
protected by a wire-netting, on which two dirty
socks were drying.</p>

<p>“For the present I can promise nothing,” said
the employment agent to Don Servando, after hearing
his story. “Tomorrow I can tell better; but
I have something good under way.”</p>

<p>“You understand what this gentleman is saying,”
said Don Servando to Manuel. “Come here tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Can you write?” Señor Mingote asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“With correct spelling?”</p>

<p>“There may be some words that I don’t
know....”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the same with me. We really great
men despise those truly petty matters. Sit down
here and get to work.” He placed a chair at the
other side of the table where the yellow man was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
writing. “This work,” he added, “will serve as
payment for the favour I’m going to do you,—finding
you a first-class situation.”</p>

<p>“Señor Mingote,” exclaimed Don Servando, “my
infinite thanks for everything.”</p>

<p>“Señor Don Servando! Always at your service!”
replied the business and employment agent, refocussing
one of his cross eyes and making a solemn bow.</p>

<p>Manuel sat down before the table, took the pen,
dipped it into the ink-well and waited for further
orders.</p>

<p>“Write one of these names on each circular,”
instructed Mingote, handing him a list of names
and a package of circulars. The agent’s handwriting
was bad, defective,—that of a man who
scarcely knows how to write. The circular was
headed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">LA EUROPEA</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Business and Employment Agency</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Bonifacio Mingote</span>, Director</p>

</div>

<p>In it were offered to the various social classes all
manner of articles, opportunities and positions.</p>

<p>One might purchase at bottom prices medicinal
remedies, meats, oilskins, fruits, shell fish, funeral
wreaths, false teeth, ladies’ hats; sputum and urine
were analyzed; the agency hunted up guaranteed
governesses; it procured notes from the courses in
Law, Medicine and special professions; it offered
capital, loans, mortgages; it arranged for sensational,
monstrous advertisements. And all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
services, plus a multitude of others, were supplied
at a minimum fee so tiny as to appear ridiculous.</p>

<p>Manuel set to work copying the names in his
best hand on to the circulars and the envelopes.</p>

<p>Señor Mingote inspected Manuel’s handwriting,
and after congratulating him, wrapped himself
up in his cloak, took two or three strides about the
room and asked his secretary:</p>

<p>“Where were we?”</p>

<p>“We were saying,” replied the amanuensis with
sinister gravity, “that the Estrellado Fernández
brand of Anis is salvation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I remember.”</p>

<p>And all at once Señor Mingote began to shout,
in a thunderous voice:</p>

<p>“What is Estrellado Fernández Anis? It is salvation,
it is life, it is energy, it is power.”</p>

<p>Manuel raised his eyes in astonishment, and
beheld the agent’s distracted gaze fixed upon the
ceiling; he was gesticulating wildly, as if threatening
some one with his right hand which was armed
with the cane, while his secretary scribbled rapidly
over the sheet.</p>

<p>“It is a fact, universally recognized by Science,”
continued Mingote in his melodramatic tones, “that
neurasthenia, asthenia, impotency, hysteria and many
other disorders of the nervous system.... What
other ailments does it cure?” Mingote paused to
ask, in his natural voice.</p>

<p>“Rickets, scrofula, chorea....”</p>

<p>“ ... That rickets, scrofula, chorea and many
other disorders of the nervous system....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon,” interrupted the amanuensis. “I believe
that rickets is not a disorder of the nervous
system.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Scratch it out. Let’s see; we were
at the nervous system, weren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“ ... And other disorders of the nervous system
come solely and exclusively from atony,—exhaustion
of the nerve-cells. Well, then,—” and Mingote
increased the volume of his voice with a new
fervour,—“Estrellado Fernández Anis corrects
this atony; Estrellado Fernández Anis, exciting
the secretion of the gastric juices, routs these ailments
which age and destroy mankind.”</p>

<p>After this paragraph, delivered with the greatest
enthusiasm and oratorical fire, Mingote brushed his
trousers with his cane and muttered, in his natural
voice.</p>

<p>“You mark my word. That Señor Fernández
won’t pay. And if only the anisette were good!
Haven’t they sent some more bottles from the
pharmacy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yesterday they sent two.”</p>

<p>“And where are they?”</p>

<p>“I took them home.”</p>

<p>“Eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They promised them to me. And since
you made off with the whole first consignment, I
took the liberty of carrying these home with me.”</p>

<p>“Lord in heaven! Excellent! First rate!...
Have folks send you some bottles of magnificent
anisette so that some other fellow with long fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
may come along and.... Good God above!”
And Mingote paused to stare at the ceiling with
one of his cross eyes.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any left?” asked his secretary.</p>

<p>“Yes, but they’ll run out at any moment.”</p>

<p>Then he began another eloquent paragraph, pacing
up and down the room, brandishing his cane,
and frequently interrupting his discourse to utter
some violent apostrophe or humorous reflection.</p>

<p>At noon the amanuensis arose, clapped his hat
down upon his head, and went off without a word
or a salute.</p>

<p>Mingote placed his hand upon Manuel’s shoulder
and said to him, in fatherly fashion:</p>

<p>“Well, you can go home now to eat, and be back
at about two.”</p>

<p>Manuel climbed up to the studio; neither Roberto
nor Alejo was there; nor was a crumb to be found
in the entire establishment. He rummaged through
all the corners, returning by half-past one, to Don
Bonifacio’s where, between one yawn and another,
he continued to address the circulars.</p>

<p>Mingote was highly pleased with Manuel’s proficiency,
and either because of this, or because at
his meal he had devoted himself excessively to
Estrellado Fernández’ Anis, he surrendered himself
to the most incoherent and picturesque verbosity,
his gaze as ever fixed upon the ceiling. Manuel
laughed loud guffaws at Don Bonifacio’s comical,
extravagant witticisms.</p>

<p>“You’re not like my secretary,” said the agent
to him, flattered by the boy’s manifestations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pleasure. “He doesn’t crack a smile at my jokes,
but then he steals them from me and repeats them,
all garbled, in those cheap little funereal pieces he
writes. And that’s not the worst. Read this.”
And Mingote handed Manuel a printed announcement.</p>

<p>This, too, was a circular in Don Bonifacio’s style.
It read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">LA BENEFACTORA</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Medico-Pharmaceutical Agency</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Don Pelayo Huesca</span>, Director</p>

<p>No one makes good his promises so well as he. The
Administrative Council of La Benefactora is composed of
the wealthiest bankers of Madrid. La Benefactora runs an
account with the Bank of Spain. There is no admission fee
to La Benefactora.</p>

<p>It proffers services as lawyer, relator, procurator, physician,
apothecary; it provides aid for births, dietary regimen,
burials, lactation, and so forth.</p>

<p>Monthly fee: one, two, two-and-a-half, three, four and
five pesetas.</p>

<p>(Actions speak louder than words)</p>

<p>General Director: <span class="smcap">Pelayo Huesca</span>, Misericordia, 6.</p>

</div>

<p>“Eh?” cried Mingote when Manuel had finished
reading. “What do you think of that? Here he
is making his living in La Europa, and then he
goes and plagiarizes me and runs La Benefactora.
That man is the same way in everything. As
treacherous as the waves. But ah, Señor Don
Pelayo, I’ll get even with you yet. If you’re a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
perfidious bat, I’ll nail you to my door; if you’re
a miserable tortoise, I’ll smash your shell for you.
Do you see, my son? What can you expect of a
country where they don’t respect intellectual property,
which is not only the most sacred, but the only
legitimate form of all property?”</p>

<p>Mingote did not point out to Manuel a note
that was printed on the margin of his circular.
This was one of Don Pelayo’s ideas. In it the
Agency offered itself for certain intimate investigations
and services. This note, very tactfully drawn
up, was addressed to those who wished to form the
acquaintance of an agreeable woman so as to complete
their education; to those who were eager to
consummate a good match; to those who harboured
doubts as to their other half; and to others, to
whom the Agency offered probing and confidential
investigations, at a low price, and vigilance by day
and by night, accomplishing all these assignments
with the utmost delicacy.</p>

<p>Mingote did not like to confess that this idea
had escaped him.</p>

<p>“Do you understand? It’s impossible to live,”
he concluded. “Folks are nothing but beasts. I
see, however, that you make distinctions, and I’ll
take you under my wing.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, through Mingote’s protection, Manuel
was able to eat that night.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow, when you arrive,” instructed Bonifacio,
“you’ll take a package of these circulars and
go around distributing them from house to house,
without missing a single one. I don’t want you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
slip them in under the doors, either. At every
house you are to knock and ask. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“In the meantime, I’ll be looking after your position.”</p>

<p>On the following day Manuel distributed a
package of circulars and returned at meal time
with his task accomplished.</p>

<p>He was getting tired of waiting when Mingote
appeared in his room; he stopped in front of Manuel,
swept his cane rapidly through the air, struck
the boy’s arms, stood still, recoiled, and shouted:</p>

<p>“Ah! Rogue! Bandit! Mountebank!”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Manuel in fright.</p>

<p>“The trouble? You knave! The trouble?
Wretch, you! You’re the luckiest fellow on two
feet; your future is assured; you’ve landed a job.”</p>

<p>“As what?”</p>

<p>“As a son.”</p>

<p>“As a son? I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>Mingote planted himself squarely, gazed at the
ceiling, saluted with his cane as a fencing-master
would with his foil, and added:</p>

<p>“You’re going to pass for the son of nothing
less than a baroness!”</p>

<p>“Who? I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’ve no cause for complaint, you rogue!
You rise out of the gutter to the heights of aristocracy.
You may even manage to acquire a title.”</p>

<p>“But is all this true?”</p>

<p>“As true as I’m the most talented man in all
Europe. So get a move on, my future Baron;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
spruce up, scratch off your dirt, brush your hair,
scrape the mud off those filthy sandals of yours, and
accompany me to the home of the baroness.”</p>

<p>Manuel was dumfounded; he could not understand
what it was all about. But he knew that
the agent would not have taken the trouble to run
all over town simply for the pleasure of perpetrating
a joke upon him.</p>

<p>At once he made ready to accompany Mingote.
Together they entered the Calle Ancha de San
Bernardo, strode down Los Reyes to the Calle
Princesa, and continued along this street until
they paused before a wide entrance, into which they
disappeared.</p>

<p>They passed into a corridor that led to a wide
patio.</p>

<p>A series of galleries with symmetrical rows of
chocolate-hued doors surrounded the patio.</p>

<p>Mingote knocked at one of the doors of the gallery
on the second floor.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked a woman’s voice from within.</p>

<p>“It’s me,” replied Mingote.</p>

<p>“I’m coming. I’m coming.”</p>

<p>The door was opened and there appeared a
mulattress in battered shoes, followed by three
poodle dogs, who barked furiously.</p>

<p>“Hush, Léon! Hush Morito!” cried the servant
in a very languid tone. “Come in. Come
in.”</p>

<p>Manuel and Mingote walked into a stifling room,
which had a window that looked upon the patio.
The walls of the room, from a certain height, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
almost covered with women’s clothes that formed
a sort of wainscoting all around it. From the
shutter-bolt of the window was suspended a low cut
sleeveless chemise with lace edging and bows of
faded blue, which displayed cynically a dark blood-stain.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment. The lady is dressing,” requested
the mulattress.</p>

<p>Within a short while she reappeared and asked
them to step into the study.</p>

<p>The baroness, a blonde woman attired in a bright
gown, was reclining upon a sofa in an attitude of intense
languor and desolation.</p>

<p>“Here again, Mingote?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame. Again.”</p>

<p>“Have a seat, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>The place was a cramped, ill-lighted room
crowded with far more furniture than it could easily
accommodate. Within a short space were heaped
together an old console with a mantle-clock upon it;
several crumpled armchairs, upon which the silk,
once upon a time red, had turned violet through the
action of the sun; two large oil portraits, and a bevelled
mirror with a cracked surface.</p>

<p>“I bring to you, dear Baroness,” said Mingote,
“the youngster of whom we have spoken.”</p>

<p>“Is this the one?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me I know this boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And I know you, too,” spoke up Manuel.
“I was in a boarding-house on the Calle de Mesonero
Romanos; the landlady’s name was Doña Casiana;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
my mother was the maid-of-all-work there.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. That’s so. And your mother,—how
is she getting along?” asked the baroness of Manuel.</p>

<p>“She’s dead.”</p>

<p>“He’s an orphan,” interjected Mingote. “As
free as the forest bird,—free to sing and to die of
hunger. It was in just such circumstances that I
myself arrived in Madrid some time back, and
queerly, strangely enough, strangely indeed, I’d like
to go back to those good old days.”</p>

<p>“And how old are you?” asked the baroness of
the boy, unheedful of the agent’s reflections.</p>

<p>“Eighteen.”</p>

<p>“But see here, Mingote,” exclaimed the baroness,
“this youngster is not the age you said he was.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter at all. Nobody would say
that he was a day over fourteen or fifteen. Hunger
does not permit the products of nature to grow.
If you cease watering a tree, or cease feeding a
human being....”</p>

<p>“Tell me,”—and the baroness interrupted Mingote
impatiently as she lowered her voice, “have
you told him what he’s wanted for?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he would have guessed it at once, anyway.
You can’t fool a kid like this, who’s knocked about
the town, as if he were a respectable child. Poverty
is a great teacher, Baroness.”</p>

<p>“And you tell that to me?” replied the lady.
“When I think of the life I’ve led and am leading
now, my hair stands on end. Without a doubt the
good Lord endowed me with a privileged nature, for
I accustom myself quite easily to everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can always lead an easy life if you wish,”
answered Mingote. “Oh! If I had only been
born a woman! What a career I’d have led!”</p>

<p>“Let’s not talk of that.”</p>

<p>“You’re right. What’s the use? Now we’ll
plan our new stratagem. I’ll get to work preparing
the proofs of the boy’s civil status. And do
you wish to take charge of him?”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“He can run your errands for you. He’s a pretty
good hand at writing.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Let him remain here.”</p>

<p>“Then, my dear Baroness, good-bye until one of
these days when I’ll bring you the documents. Dear
lady ... at your feet.”</p>

<p>“Ay, how ceremonious! Good-bye, Mingote!
See him out, Manuel.”</p>

<p>The two men walked to the door together.
There the agent placed his hands upon the youth’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my lad,” he said. “And don’t forget,
if ever you should become a baron in real earnest,
that you owe it all to me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not forget. You needn’t worry on that
score,” answered Manuel.</p>

<p>“You’ll always remember your protector?”</p>

<p>“Always.”</p>

<p>“My son, preserve that filial piety. For a protector
such as I is almost like a father. He is ...
I was about to say, the arm of Providence. I feel
deeply moved.... I am no longer young. Have
you, by any chance, a few coins in your pocket?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” and Mingote, after a sweep
with his cane, left the house.</p>

<p>Manuel closed the door and returned to the room
on tip-toe.</p>

<p>“Chucha! Chucha!” called the baroness. And
when the mulattress appeared who had opened the
door to Mingote and Manuel, the baroness said to
her:</p>

<p>“See. This is the boy.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jesu! Jesu!</i>” shrieked the servant. “He’s a
ragamuffin! Whatever put it into madame’s head
to bring such a tramp into the house?”</p>

<p>Before such an outburst as this, although it was
spoken in the most mellifluous and languid of tones,
Manuel stood paralyzed.</p>

<p>“You’ve terrified the lad,” exclaimed the baroness,
bursting into loud laughter.</p>

<p>“But Your Grace must be mad,” muttered the
servant.</p>

<p>“Hush! Hush! Not so much noise. Get
some soap and water ready for him and have him
wash up.”</p>

<p>The mulattress left, and the baroness scrutinized
Manuel closely.</p>

<p>“So the man told you what you’ve come here
for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he told me something.”</p>

<p>“And are you willing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, Señora.”</p>

<p>“Good. You’re a philosopher. I’m quite satisfied.
And what have you done up to now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel recounted his adventures, drawing a little
upon his imagination, and entertained the baroness
for a while.</p>

<p>“Fine. Don’t say a word to anybody, understand?...
And now go and wash yourself.”</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Baroness de Aynant, Her Dogs and Her Mulattress
Companion—Wherein is Prepared a Farce</p>

</div>

<p>Little work, little to eat and clean clothes:
these were the conditions that Manuel found
in the home of the baroness, and they were
unsurpassable.</p>

<p>In the morning his duty was to take the baroness’s
dogs out for a stroll; in the afternoon he had to
run a few errands. At times, during the first days,
he felt homesick for his wandering existence. Several
issues of huge novels published in serial form,
which Chucha lent him, allayed his passion for
tramping about the streets and transported him, in
company of Fernández y González and Tárrago y
Mateos, to the life of the XVIIth century, with its
braggart knights and its lovelorn ladies.</p>

<p>Niña Chucha, an eternal chatterbox, recounted to
Manuel, in several instalments, the tale of her dear
friend, as she called the baroness.</p>

<p>The Baroness de Aynant, Paquita Figueroa, was
a queer woman. Her father, a wealthy Cuban gentleman,
sent her at the age of eighteen, accompanied
by an aunt, on a trip to Europe. On the steamer a
young Flemish gentleman, fair and blond, as elegant
as a Van Dyck portrait, had paid her much attention;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the girl had responded with all the ardent enthusiasm
of the tropics, and within a month after
their arrival in Spain, the Cuban miss was named
the Baroness de Aynant, and left with her husband
to take up their residence in Antwerp.</p>

<p>The honeymoon waned, and both the Flemish
gentleman and the Cuban wife, once they had settled
down again to a tranquil existence, agreed that they
were not a congenial, well-matched couple. He
was devoted to the simple, methodical life, to the
music of Beethoven and to meals prepared
with cows’ butter; she, on the other hand, was
fond of a wild time, of gadding about the fashionable
promenades; she loved a dry, hot climate, the
music of Chueca, light meals and dishes made with
oil.</p>

<p>These divergencies of taste in small matters,
piling up, thickening, in time clouded completely the
love of the baron and his wife. She could not let
pass calmly the cold, tranquilly ironic remarks that
her husband made concerning the sweet-potatoes,
the oil and the accent of the southern peoples. The
baron, in turn, was piqued to hear his wife speak
scornfully of the greasy women who devote themselves
to cramming down butter. The rivalry between
oil and butter, embroiling itself, interweaving
itself with their other affairs of greater importance,
assumed such proportions that the couple reached
the point of excitement and hatred leading to a
separation. The baron remained in Antwerp dedicating
himself to his artistic predilections and to
his buttered toast, while the baroness came to Madrid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
where she could give free rein to her fondness
for fruit and oily food.</p>

<p>In Madrid the baroness committed a thousand
follies. She tried to procure a divorce, that she
might marry a ruined aristocrat. But when her bill
of divorcement was all prepared for filing, she
learned that her husband was seriously ill, and no
sooner did she get the news than she left Madrid,
hurried to Antwerp, nursed the baron, saved his
life, fell in love all over again and presented him
with a baby girl.</p>

<p>During this second epoch of their love the couple
threw a dense veil over the great question that had
formerly divided them. The baroness and the
baron made mutual concessions, and the baroness
was well on the way to becoming an excellent Flemish
dame when she was left a widow.</p>

<p>She returned to Madrid with her daughter, and
soon her Levantine instincts reawakened. Her
brother-in-law, uncle and guardian of the child,
helped her out with a monthly stipend, but this was
not enough. A friend of her father’s,—a certain
Don Sergio Redondo, a very wealthy merchant,—offered
her his hand; but the baroness did not accept,
and preferred his patronage to being his wife. Soon
she deceived him with another, and for twelve years
she continued this duplicity.</p>

<p>In the midst of this squandering, this madness
and surrender to caprice, the baroness preserved a
moral background, and withdrew her daughter completely
from the world in which the mother dwelt.
She placed her child in a convent school and every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
month, the first money that she laid hands upon was
used to pay for the girl’s tuition. When she had
completed her education, the baroness intended to
take her off to Antwerp and live there with her,
resigning herself to the career of a respectable
woman.</p>

<p>Niña Chucha would grumble and protest at her
good friend’s whims, but she always ended by obeying
them.</p>

<p>Manuel found the house a paradise; he had nothing
to do and would spend his idle hours smoking,
if there were anything to smoke, or walking along
the Moncloa, accompanied by the baroness’s three
dogs.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mingote was hard at work. His
plan was to exploit Don Sergio Redondo, friend of
the baroness’s father and former protector of the
lady. The latter, with the instincts of an intriguing,
deceitful wench, had informed her former protector
that their relations had produced a boy; then she
had told him that the boy had died, and afterward,
that the boy was still alive.</p>

<p>All these affirmations and denials the lady accompanied
with a request for money, to which Don
Sergio acceded; until the victim, rendered suspicious,
notified the baroness that he did not believe in the
existence of that son. The baroness upbraided him
as a miserable wretch and Don Sergio answered, pretending
not to understand, and keeping a tight lock
on his money-chest.</p>

<p>How had Mingote discovered these facts? Undoubtedly
it had not been the baroness who told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
him, but he ferreted them out none the less. And
as his imagination was fertile, it occurred to him
to propose to the baroness that she hunt up some
boy, provide him with false documents and pass
him off as Don Sergio’s son.</p>

<p>The baroness, who knew nothing whatever about
the law and considered the Penal Code a net spread
to catch vagabonds, seized upon the suggestion as a
most excellent and fruitful plan. Mingote demanded
a share in the profits and the baroness
promised him all he should desire. From that moment
Mingote set about searching for a youngster
who would fulfill the conditions necessary to the deception
of Don Sergio, and when he came upon
Manuel, he brought him at once to the home of the
baroness.</p>

<p>After he had been there a week, Manuel was
already provided with the papers that identified him
as Sergio Figueroa. Between Mingote, Don Pelayo
the amanuensis, and a friend of theirs called Peñalar,
they forged them with most exquisite skill.</p>

<p>“And now what shall we do?” asked the baroness.</p>

<p>Mingote stood wrapped in thought. If the baroness
were to write to Don Sergio, that old fellow,
in all probability, since he was now suspicious, might
take the whole matter sceptically. They must,
therefore, discover some indirect procedure,—they
must let him get the news from a third party.</p>

<p>“Suppose it were to be from a confessor? What
do you think of that?” asked Mingote.</p>

<p>“A confessor?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A priest who would present himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Don Sergio’s home and inform him that, under the
seal of confession, you had told him....”</p>

<p>“No, no,” interrupted the baroness. “And where
is this priest?”</p>

<p>“Peñalar will go, in disguise.”</p>

<p>“No. Besides, Don Sergio knows that I’m not
very religious.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps a schoolmaster would be better.”</p>

<p>“But do you imagine that he’s going to believe I
confess to a schoolmaster?”</p>

<p>“No. We’ll have to alter the plan. The master
will go to see Don Sergio and tell him that he has a
boy in his school, a young prodigy, who is sadly neglected
by his mother. One day he asks the prodigy:
‘What’s your father’s and mother’s name, my boy?’
And the boy replies: ‘I haven’t any father or
mother; my step-mother is the Baroness de Aynant.’
Then he, the teacher, comes to see you and you tell
him that you’re badly off and that you can’t pay the
child’s tuition fee, and that his father, a wealthy
gentleman, does not even care to know him. The
evangelical master asks you several times for the
name of this inhuman parent; you refuse to divulge
it; but at last he wrests from your lips the name of
that cruel creature. The sublime pedagogue then
says: ‘I cannot permit the abandonment of this
child, of this extraordinary child,’ and he determines
to go to see the father of the child.... Well, what
do you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Not a badly woven plot. But who’s going to
play the schoolmaster? You?”</p>

<p>“No, Peñalar. He was simply made for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
part. He was a tutor in a college; you’ll see. This
very day I’ll hunt him up and bring him here. In
the meantime, you prepare Manuel. Let him look
somewhat like a schoolboy. While I’m out looking
for Peñalar, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for you to
teach him a little,—the first questions and answers
of the catechism, for example.”</p>

<p>In accordance with Mingote’s instructions, the
baroness ordered Manuel to comb his hair and
spruce up; then she fished out for him a sailor suit
with a large white collar. Yet however much they
might adorn him and ply their arts upon his person,
it was impossible to make him look like a respectable
youngster; his indifferent, roguish eyes and his
smile, which was half bitter and half sarcastic, betrayed
the ragamuffin.</p>

<p>At two o’clock Mingote was back at the baroness’s
home, with a dark man of clerical aspect.
The man, named Peñalar, spoke with great emphasis;
then, when Mingote stated his proposition,
Peñalar, abandoning his emphatic tone, discussed
the conditions of payment and the percentage due
him.</p>

<p>He hesitated about accepting the commission, in
order to see whether he could get more favourable
terms, but, finding Mingote unyielding, he accepted.</p>

<p>“Let the boy come along with me this very minute.”</p>

<p>Peñalar brushed the sleeves of his black frock
coat, combed his hair back, and taking Manuel by
the hand, said to him in a truly evangelical voice:</p>

<p>“Come, my child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Sergio Redondo had a flour shop on the
Plaza del Progreso.</p>

<p>They reached the square and walked into the
shop.</p>

<p>“Don Sergio Redondo?” asked Peñalar of an
old man in a flat, woolen cap.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t come down to the office yet.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait. Tell him that there’s a gentleman
here who would like to see him.”</p>

<p>“Very well. And who shall I say is waiting for
him?”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t know me. Just tell him that it’s
a family matter. Sit down, my boy,” added Peñalar,
turning to Manuel, with a voice and a smile
of purely evangelical unction.</p>

<p>Manuel took a seat, and Peñalar let his gaze
wander about the shop with the calmness and ease
of one who is fully confident and aware of just what
he is about.</p>

<p>The old man in the woolen cap soon reappeared.</p>

<p>“Step into the office,” and he pushed back a black
screen set with striped panes. “The master will
be in presently.”</p>

<p>Peñalar and Manuel entered a room lighted by
a grated window, and sat down upon a green sofa.
Opposite them rose a mahogany closet lined with
business books; in the middle stood a writing desk
with many drawers, and to one side of this, a safe
with gilt knobs.</p>

<p>The room exhaled the spirit of an implacable
merchant. One readily saw that this cage held an
ugly bird. Manuel was terrified. Peñalar himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
perhaps, experienced a moment of weakness, but he
swelled up with importance, twirled his moustaches,
carefully adjusted his spectacles upon his nose and
smiled.</p>

<p>Don Sergio did not keep them waiting long. He
was a tall old fellow, with white moustaches, and a
suspicious glance which he shot obliquely over the
rim of his glasses. He wore a long frock coat,
bright-coloured trousers, a skull cap of green velvet
with a long tassel that hung down one side. He
strode in without a greeting, and eyed the man and
the boy with evident displeasure. They arose.
Perhaps he even thought that he had divined the
reason of the Visit, for in a dry, authoritarian voice,
and without bidding them be seated, he asked Peñalar:</p>

<p>“What do you wish, sir? Was it you who had
something to say to me with reference to a family
matter? You?”</p>

<p>Any other person would have been seized with a
desire to strangle the old man. Not Peñalar, however;
difficult situations were his forte, and most to
his taste. He began to speak, unabashed by the
inquisitorial glances of the merchant.</p>

<p>Manuel listened to him with a mingling of admiration
and terror. He could see that the old
man was growing angrier every second. Peñalar
spoke on unperturbed.</p>

<p>He was a poor captive soul, a sentimentalist, an
idealist—ah!—devoted to the instruction of youth,—that
youth in whose bosom repose the seeds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the nation’s regeneration. He had suffered a great
deal,—a great deal. He had been in the hospital.
A man such as he, who knew French, English, German,
who played the piano,—a man of his stamp,
related to the entire aristocracy of the kingdom of
León, a man who knew more theology and theodocy
than all the priests rolled into one.</p>

<p>Ah! He did not say all this out of vainglory;
but he had a right to life. Gómez Sánchez, the illustrious
histologist, had once said to him:</p>

<p>“You ought not to work.”</p>

<p>“But I’m hungry.”</p>

<p>“Then beg.”</p>

<p>Wherefore sometimes he did beg.</p>

<p>Don Sergio, utterly astounded before this avalanche
of words, made no attempt to interrupt Peñalar.
The latter paused, smiled unctuously, noted
that the force of habit had carried him on to his
everlasting theme of the reason for his sponging on
folks, and realizing that his eloquence was leading
him astray, lowered his voice, continuing in a confidential
tone:</p>

<p>“This our life is, despite all its drawbacks, so attractive,—is
it not so, Don Sergio?—that one cannot
leave it with indifference. And yet I believe
that death is liberation. Yes, I believe in the immortality
of the soul, in the absolute dominion of
spirit over matter. Not so in previous years. No,
I must confess,” and he smiled more benignly than
ever, “I was formerly a pantheist, and I still preserve,
from that period, perhaps, an enthusiasm for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
nature. Ah, the country! The country is my delight!
Many a time I recall those verses of the
Mantuan:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Te, dulcis conjux, te solo in litore secum</div>
<div class="verse">te veniente die, te decedente canebat.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Are you fond of the country, Don Sergio? You
really should be, with all the gifts you possess.”</p>

<p>Don Sergio’s anger, which had been rising together
with Peñalar’s incoherent verbosity, exploded
into one curt sentence:</p>

<p>“I abominate the country.”</p>

<p>Peñalar stopped short with mouth agape.</p>

<p>“Sir, my dear sir,” added the merchant, raising
his furious voice, “if you have plenty of time to
waste, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t yet told you the reason for my visit,”
said Peñalar, removing his glasses and preparing
to wipe them with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“No, and it isn’t necessary. I can imagine it
very well. I give no charity.”</p>

<p>“My worthy Señor Don Sergio,” and Peñalar
arose, spectacles in hand, turning his short-sighted
glances about the room, “you have made a grievous
mistake. I have not come to ask alms nor is that a
habit of mine. No one may contradict that statement.
I have come,” and he placed his glasses resolutely
in their position, “to fulfil a sacred duty.”</p>

<p>“Let’s be done with this. What sacred duty are
you talking about? To the point! Enough of the
farce. I hate charlatanry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Allow me to have a seat. I am weary,” murmured
Peñalar in a frail voice. “Is any one within
hearing?”</p>

<p>Don Sergio glared at him like a hyena. Peñalar
passed his riddled handkerchief across his broad
forehead; then, turning to Manuel, who was still
regarding the scene in complete amazement, he said
to him:</p>

<p>“Please, my dear child, leave us alone for a
moment and wait for me outside.”</p>

<p>Manuel opened the office door and walked out
into the shop. This manœuvre caused Don Sergio
to start back in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I, my worthy sir,” said Peñalar, as soon as he
found himself alone with the merchant, “am dedicated
to the education of youth.”</p>

<p>“You’re a schoolmaster? So I’ve already heard.”</p>

<p>“I was acting as examiner in the Colegio del Espíritu
Santo, when it occurred to me to go into
business on my own account.”</p>

<p>“And you lost money. Very well. But how
does all this concern me?” shrilled Don Sergio,
pounding upon the table with a book.</p>

<p>“I crave your pardon. Among my pupils I have
this boy who has just left us. He is a prodigy, a
youngster of extraordinary talents. When I saw
how bright he was, how determined, I conceived an
interest in him; I inquired about his family, and was
told that he had neither father nor mother, and had
been taken into a certain lady’s home.”</p>

<p>“Well, what has all this got to do with me?”</p>

<p>“Patience, Don Sergio. I went to see this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
lady, who is a baroness, and I said to her, ‘The boy
whom you have taken into your home is worthy of
the utmost encouragement. Something should be
done for his education.’</p>

<p>“‘His mother has no means and his father, who
is very wealthy, does nothing for him,’ was the baroness’s
reply.</p>

<p>“‘Tell me who his father is, and I’ll go to see
him,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘It’s no use,’ she answered, ‘for you’ll get nothing
out of him. His name is Don Sergio Redondo.’”</p>

<p>As he pronounced these words, Peñalar got up,
and with his head thrown back contemplated Don
Sergio, even as the exterminating angel glances upon
a poor reprobate. Don Sergio turned frightfully
pale, pulled out his handkerchief, rubbed his lips,
hawked. It was easily to be seen that he was perturbed.</p>

<p>Peñalar scrutinized the old man keenly, and
noting that his arrogance was abating, became more
evangelical and moral than ever.</p>

<p>“The baroness,” he added, “said to me,—and you
must pardon my undeviating sincerity—she said to
me that you were an egotist and a heartless creature.
But despite this,” and he smiled sweetly, feeling
himself by now quite supermoral and superevangelic,
“I thought: My duty is to go to see that gentleman.
That is why I have come. Now you will do
as your conscience dictates. I have followed the
dictates of mine.”</p>

<p>After this little speech Peñalar had nothing more
to add, and with the smile of the entire martyrology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
upon his lips he took his hat, saluted most ceremoniously
and drew near to the door.</p>

<p>“And that youngster is the boy who was here?”
asked Don Sergio in a low, hesitant voice.</p>

<p>“That is he.”</p>

<p>“And where does this woman live,—this baroness?”
exclaimed the merchant.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you. I shall ask her first. If she
authorizes me to tell, I will return with the answer.”</p>

<p>And Peñalar left the office.</p>

<p>“Come along, my boy,” he said to Manuel.</p>

<p>And with proud, noble demeanour, head erect, he
left the place, leading his beloved pupil by the
hand,—that portentous child so little appreciated
by his parents.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Life and Miracles of Señor de Mingote—Wherein
Beginneth the Succulent Exploitation of Don Sergio</p>

</div>

<p>According to the best historians of Madrid
the acquaintance of the Baroness de
Aynant with Bonifacio de Mingote dated
back some two years.</p>

<p>During one of the numerous periods in which the
baroness had found herself financially embarrassed
she had resorted to a usurer on the Calle del Pez.
Instead of the moneylender there appeared his
clerk, Mingote himself, who arranged the matter
between the two of them. Ever since that time
Mingote was a regular visitor at the baroness’s.
Who was Don Bonifacio? What was Don Bonifacio?</p>

<p>There are bimanous creatures who rouse a most
extraordinary curiosity. In the natural history of
man they resemble those species of monotremes situated
between the birds and the mammals,—the
wonder of zoölogists. It is to this class of interesting
bimanal animals that Mingote belonged.</p>

<p>This Mingote was about fifty, short, stout, with
dyed moustaches, fleshy face, red, tiny nose, cynical
mouth and the general appearance of a police agent
or a busybody broker. He dressed ostentatiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and delighted in wearing a thick chain in his waistcoat
and false diamonds, as big as chick-peas, on
his shirt-front and his fingers.</p>

<p>Mingote had exercised every office that a person
may engage in outside the boundaries of decency:
he had been a usurer, a member of the police, leader
of a claque, exchange broker, rural home agent,
court officer, procurer....</p>

<p>Manuel had the opportunity of knowing him inside
out. He was a past master in all the arts of
deception,—an ingrate, impudent, cowardly with
the brave and brave with cowards, as petulant and
vain as few, fond of attributing to himself the
bravery and merit that belonged to another, and
of distributing among others the defects that were
exclusively his own.</p>

<p>Manuel noticed that the baroness was always in
the habit of speaking ill of Mingote, whenever
that worthy was absent, and yet, when she listened
to his chatter, she did so with evident pleasure.
Doubtless she admired his subtlety and the rogue’s
finesse in his evil arts.</p>

<p>After he had been speaking for some time his
shameless conversation would become repellent.</p>

<p>Mingote’s chief preoccupation was to conceal
his cynical nature, but his cynicism, through its very
powers of expansion, oozed from his very soul,
glittered in his eyes, flickered on his lips and flowed
in his every word.</p>

<p>“Folks who insult me only waste their time,” he
would declare, calmly. “When it comes to shamelessness,
I can’t be beat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>And he was right. There were times in which he
would realize the bad effect produced by some rascality
of his, whereupon he would make special
efforts to appear a very Roland or Cid of perfection.
But within a very short while from out of the
cuirass of this punctilious knight would stick the
mountebank’s claw.</p>

<p>“In matters of honor I admit of no distinctions,”
the man would say, in one of his knightly moods.
“You may declare to me that honor is a martingale.
True enough. But such is my misfortune; I am by
temperament a cavalier.”</p>

<p>Mingote was a partisan of anarchico-philanthropico-collectivist
ideas; some of his letters he ended
with the salutation, “Health and Social Revolution,”
which served as no obstacle against his trying
to establish, at various times, a loan shop, a house of
assignation and other similarly honest means of subsistence.</p>

<p>This ex-loan shark had collaborated in several
ignominious labours with the comrades of dynamite
and picric acid, wheedling money out of them, now
for the purpose of effecting a coup and purchasing
bombs, again for the compiling of a libertarian dictionary,
wherein he, Mingote, with his formidable
powers of analysis, more formidable than the
highest explosives, shattered to fragments all the
traditional notions of this stupid society.</p>

<p>Whenever Mingote spoke of his dictionary, his
disdain for existence, his fanatical glance, his melancholy
attitude of a soul misunderstood all indicated
the genius of revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, when he recounted his successes
as an advertising agent, as a business broker,
the modern man would appear,—the struggle-for-lifer
of the public auction and the loan shop, of the
druggist and the perfumer.</p>

<p>“It was I,” he would boast, “who auctioned off
La Chavito. I sold the stable to the Marquis de
Sacro-Cerro and the lands to the Viscountess. It
was I who launched the Pipot Cataphoretic; the Alex
Wild Arabian Jasmine Pectoral; Chiper’s Manicure
Paste; Pirogoff’s Electrical Cataplasm; Clarckson’s
Peptic Flour; Tomás y Gil’s Artificial Heart;
Rocagut’s Sudorific Plaster, and yet, here I stand,
utterly deserted.”</p>

<p>Mingote imagined that all Madrid was in a conspiracy
to keep him down; but he was waiting for the
opportune moment in which he should triumph over
his enemies.</p>

<p>His greatest illusions were founded upon his
mines, which, though they were supposedly wonderful,
he was not averse to selling in cheap lots. He
was for ever carrying around in his pockets, wrapped
up in newspaper sheets, various specimens from his
mines in this place and that.</p>

<p>“This,” and Mingote would exhibit a bit of ore,
“comes from the Suspiro del Moro Mine. What
a specimen! Eh? Admirable. Isn’t it? Iron
... almost pure. Ninety nine and one half per
cent. mineralized. This other is of calamine. Sixty
eight per cent. There are half a million tons.”</p>

<p>When his hoax had been discovered, not only was
he unperturbed, but he would burst into laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The baroness greeted Mingote’s projects with
loud guffaws.</p>

<p>“But if you haven’t any mines, how are you going
to sell them?” she would ask.</p>

<p>“Ah, that doesn’t matter. I invent them. It’s
the same thing. As soon as we have put this thing
through with Don Sergio we’ll go into business.
We’ll lay out a mine; deposit, three or four hundred
pesetas, whatever it amounts to. Then we’ll carry
minerals from somewhere else to the land, and at
once we issue shares: The Prosperity Company,
Limited. Capital, 7,000,000 pesetas. We rent
a building, put up an imposing copper sign with gilt
lettering over the door and a servant in blue livery.
We’ll collect on the shares, and the deal is worked.”</p>

<p>Did Mingote believe in his fancies? He himself
could not have said for certain. The man was a
stranger even to himself. There, within his soul, he
harboured the notion of an adverse fate which prevented
his prospering because he was an unblushing
knave. As for skill, he had enough and to spare;
nobody was as wily as he in receiving a creditor and
sending him off unpaid; he was an expert in adulation
and mendacity; yet, despite his constant lying, he
was as gullible as any one else when it came to the
deceptions of other rogues.</p>

<p>He believed in secret societies, in Free Masonry,
in the H ... and all such mummery.</p>

<p>Amidst danger and perilous situations, despite the
extraordinary cowardice of the ex-loan shark, his
cleverness never abandoned him. Cracking a joke
was a necessity to him, and in all probability, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
he impaled, with the hangman’s rope around his
neck, or on the very steps of the scaffold, all atremble
with terror, he would have had to make some droll
remark between the chattering of his teeth and the
tremors of horror.</p>

<p>He would quarrel with folk about the most futile
matters; in the street cars and at the theatres he
would get into altercations with the conductors and
ushers; he would raise his stick to the street-urchins,
and treat everybody with the utmost disdain. He
would make indecorous proposals to women in the
very presence of their husbands or their parents, and
despite all this, he very rarely received the cuffs or
the cudgellings that any one else in his place would
have earned.</p>

<p>Vainglorious and petulant, he himself would laugh
at his petulance. He would transform his smile into
a menacing gesture, and his menacing gesture into a
smile; at times he felt a certain rare, comical sort of
modesty and would blush, but never did he lose his
self-composure.</p>

<p>The ex-loan shark, though he was by no means of
an agreeable type, was very successful with the
women. He devoted himself to old age. His tactics
were rapid and expedite; after the first week he
was already borrowing money.</p>

<p>He counted his mistresses in pairs, each with two
or three little Mingotes. In complicity with them
the ex-moneylender had organized a marvellous system
of mendicity carried on through means of letters,
and as the income from his agency kept dwindling,
these mistresses, the great Mingote and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
little Mingotes, managed to live upon the profits of
the women. Whenever people inquired as to these
women, Mingote replied that they constituted his
household servants.</p>

<p>This was Mingote, the marvellous, rare Mingote,
aider and abettor of the Baroness of Aynant.</p>

<p>The very day on which Manuel and the sublime
pedagogue recounted the details of their visit to Don
Sergio, the baroness and Mingote inaugurated their
campaign. The baroness rented a parlour for a
few days from a boarding-house keeper on the first
floor.</p>

<p>“But what are you doing this for?” asked
Mingote. “The worse the old man finds you
situated, the more splendid it will be for our purpose.”</p>

<p>“I gave you credit for more cleverness than that,
Mingote,” replied the baroness coldly. “If Don
Sergio were to find me in a filthy hole like this, he’d
throw me an alms. But otherwise,—we’ll see.
For the rest, kindly let me conduct my own affairs.”</p>

<p>Mingote, confounded, kept silent. Undoubtedly
in such a matter as this, he had something to learn.</p>

<p>The baroness arranged her rented room in good
taste, sent one of her gowns out to be sewed and
ironed, and dressed Manuel, even using rice powder,
to the great desperation of the child. When all was
in readiness, Mingote wrote to Don Sergio,—<i>il
vecchio Cromwell</i>, as he called the old man,—a post
card signed by Peñalar, giving him the directions to
the house.</p>

<p>The baroness and Manuel awaited the arrival of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<i>il vecchio</i>. About midafternoon they heard the
rumble of a carriage that drew up before their door.</p>

<p>“There he is,” said the baroness. She peered
through the slats of the shutters. “Yes, it’s he,”
she added, lying down upon the sofa and picking up
a book.</p>

<p>When she was well dressed and decked out she
appeared appetizing; a blonde, buxom, good-looking
wench.</p>

<p>“See here. It would be better for you to go into
that other room,” said the baroness to Manuel,
pointing to a bedchamber. “I’ll tell him that you’re
studying.”</p>

<p>Manuel, who was by no means delighted with the
rôle that had been assigned to him, disappeared into
the alcove. Between this and the parlour was a
curtained glass door. Manuel found this observation
post quite comfortable, and began to spy
through the shades. He was interested to see how
the baroness would manage, how she would weave
the strands of that deception, in which the least
oversight might enmesh her.</p>

<p>When the maidservant of the boarding-house
entered to announce Don Sergio, the baroness was
already completely submerged in her part. <i>Il
vecchio</i> came in solemnly, and saluted her; the
baroness made a gesture of astonishment at sight of
him, and then, with a languorous, haughty wave of
the hand she indicated that he might be seated.</p>

<p>“The old <i>Cromwell</i>,” took a seat; Manuel could
observe him calmly. He was pale,—of a chalky
complexion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“An ugly old papa I’ve picked up,” said Manuel
to himself.</p>

<p>The baroness and Don Sergio began to talk in
whispers. It was impossible to hear what they
were saying. The chalky-complexioned old fellow
gazed about the room, estimated the furniture,
and was doubtless surprised to find so elegant a
parlour.</p>

<p>Then he continued to speak heatedly; the
baroness listened to him languidly, smiling with a
certain amiable, kindly irony. It seemed to Manuel
that all the old man needed was a pair of little horns
and goat’s feet to represent, together with the
baroness, a group he had seen a few days previously
in a show-window on the Carrera de San Jerónimo.
The title was “The Nymph and the Satyr.”
Manuel thought that the old man was about to get
down on his knees, and he felt like shouting, “Get
out, <i>Cromwell</i>!”</p>

<p>The old gentleman continued to speak in his insinuating
manner, when all at once he grew excited
and began to gesticulate violently. “This abandonment
of the boy is unspeakable!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Unspeakable!”</p>

<p>“Yes, señora.”</p>

<p>“But you,—what right have you to speak?”</p>

<p>“Every right in the world. Yes, señora.”</p>

<p>The baroness seemed to be amazed at these
words, and replied with vague excuses; then she became
indignant and rising most gracefully from the
sofa threw the book onto the floor, and accused the
irate <i>Cromwell</i> of every ill that might befall the boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
He was to blame for everything, because he was a
miserly old wretch.</p>

<p>The terrible <i>vecchio</i> replied to this arraignment in
a brusk tone, averring that to lewd, extravagant
women all men were stingy.</p>

<p>“If you have come here,” interrupted the
baroness, “to insult a woman because she is alone
and unprotected, I’ll not have it.”</p>

<p>Then came the chalky old man’s explanations, his
efforts to clear himself of blame, his offers....</p>

<p>“I need you for nothing,” retorted the baroness
haughtily. “I did not send for you.”</p>

<p>The <i>vecchio</i> coaxingly vowed and vowed again
that he had come there only to offer her whatever
she might need, and to beg her to let him stand the
expenses of the boy’s education. He desired also
to see the youngster a moment.</p>

<p>The baroness allowed herself to be won over;
but she warned the chalky old fellow that the boy
thought his parents had died.</p>

<p>“No, no. Don’t worry, Paquita,” exclaimed <i>il
vecchio</i>.</p>

<p>The baroness rang the bell and asked the servant,
in most nonchalant fashion:</p>

<p>“Is Sergio at home?”</p>

<p>“Yes, señora.”</p>

<p>“Ask him to come in.”</p>

<p>Manuel entered, in confusion.</p>

<p>“This gentleman wishes to see you,” said the
lady.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told—I’ve been told that you are a
very good student,” mumbled <i>il vecchio</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel raised his two eyes in the greatest
astonishment. Don Sergio pinched the boy’s none
too rosy cheeks. Manuel stood there gazing at the
floor, and after the baroness had given him permission,
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>“He’s very shy,” explained the baroness.</p>

<p>“I was the same way myself when I was his age,”
replied Don Sergio.</p>

<p>The lady smiled maliciously. Manuel went back
to his place in the bed chamber and continued to spy
upon them; the baroness bewailed her lack of means;
<i>Cromwell</i> defended himself like a lion. At the conclusion
of the conference the chalky old fellow drew
out his wallet and deposited several banknotes upon
the night table.</p>

<p>The baroness saw him to the door.</p>

<p>“So, Paquita, you are quite satisfied now?” he
asked, before leaving.</p>

<p>“Ever so much!”</p>

<p>“And you’re not sorry that I came to see you?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Don Sergio! You deserted me so cruelly.
And you—the only friend of my poor father!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s true, Paquita, it’s true,” murmured <i>il
vecchio</i>, taking one of the baroness’s plump hands
and fondling it.</p>

<p>And he descended the stairs, pausing every
moment to bid the lady adieu.</p>

<p>“Good Lord, what an old bore!” she grumbled,
slamming the door. “Manuel, Manolito, you did
splendidly! You’re a hero! Did you see? <i>Il
vecchio Cromwell</i>, as Mingote calls him, has left a
thousand pesetas. This very next day we move.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Very early on the following morning the baroness
and Manuel went out in search of new rooms.
After endless running about, their heads almost out
of joint from so much gazing upward, they found
a third floor apartment in the Plaza de Oriente,
with which the baroness was simply enchanted. It
cost twenty-five duros per month.</p>

<p>“It’ll seem dear to Niña Chucha, but I’ll take
it,” said the baroness.</p>

<p>So she called at the first floor, where the house
agent lived, talked to him and made an advance
payment.</p>

<p>They moved in that very day, and Manuel
laboured away with enthusiasm, carrying furniture
from one place to the other, and setting the pieces
down in the new quarters as Niña Chucha directed
him.</p>

<p>As the furnishings of the house were rather
meagre, and the baroness had some things stored
away in the home of a Cuban woman, a friend of
hers, she went several days later to see the lady
and ask for the furniture. She did not show up
during that whole day, nor did she appear for
supper, but returned very late at night. Niña
Chucha and Manuel waited up for her. She came
home with eyes that shone more brightly than usual.</p>

<p>“The Colonel’s wife wouldn’t let me go,” she
mumbled. “I dined with her, then I went with her
daughters to the <i>Apolo</i> and they saw me to the
door.”</p>

<p>Manuel could not understand how this could be so
unusual for the baroness, and was quite astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to hear her reply to Niña Chucha’s recriminations,
stammering and laughing at the top of her voice in
a most incoherent manner. Manuel would have
sworn that, as she left the dining-room, the baroness
stumbled, but he was so sleepy that he was not certain,
and he refrained from comment.</p>

<p>On the following day, just before lunch, Niña
Chucha was in the street when there was a knock at
the door. Manuel opened. It was the chalky old
man.</p>

<p>“Hello, student,” he saluted. “And where is
Doña Paquita?”</p>

<p>“In her room,” was Manuel’s reply.</p>

<p>Don Sergio rapped at the door with his knuckles
and repeated several times:</p>

<p>“May I come in?”</p>

<p>“Come in, Don Sergio,” invited the baroness,
“and open the windows.”</p>

<p>The old man entered the room, tripped against
the packages scattered over the floor, and opened
the balcony shutters.</p>

<p>“But, dear Paquita? Still abed?” he asked,
greatly astonished. “That’s not good for your
health.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you could only see how hard I’ve been
working,” replied the baroness, stretching herself.
“Yesterday I went to bed completely exhausted, and
at five this morning I was already at work. But all
this dragging of household effects has given me a
terrible headache, and has forced me to lie down
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do you work so hard? You don’t have
to.”</p>

<p>“There are things to be done; then again, in this
house there is no one to lend a hand. All Chucha
does is read novels. And as for Sergio, I’m not
going to have him travel around like a porter. So
that everything falls on my shoulders. I hope I’ll
be feeling much better some other day, and then
you’ll have the pleasure of seeing what a good girlie
I am, and how I follow your instructions to the
letter.”</p>

<p>“Excellent, Paquita, excellent. Just keep on
being a good little girlie.”</p>

<p>The baroness, to prove how genuine was her girlishness,
bestowed a few caresses upon <i>Cromwell</i>
and then, in an indifferent tone, asked him for fifty
pesetas.</p>

<p>“But....”</p>

<p>“Indeed I know that you’re going to scold me.
Don’t you imagine that I’ve spent all the money, or
anything like it. The truth is, I have a five-hundred
peseta note that I don’t want to break, and as there’s
a little account I’ve got to settle....”</p>

<p>“Very well, here you are.” And Don Sergio,
with a smile that was meant to be amiable, extracted
his pocket book from his pocket and left a blue bill
upon the night table; whereupon he was seized with
the notion that it was not very gallant to leave only
what had been asked for, so he deposited another
note.</p>

<p>The baroness placed the candlestick upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
two notes and then, huddling into the bedclothes, she
murmured in a drowsy voice:</p>

<p>“Ay, Don Sergio, my headache’s coming back!”</p>

<p>“Take good care of yourself, then, my dear.
Take good care and don’t work so hard.”</p>

<p>After closing the balcony shutters, Don Sergio
left the bedroom and met Niña Chucha, who had
just come in from the street.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t allow your mistress to work so
hard,” he said to her dryly. “She’s getting ill.”</p>

<p>The mulattress gazed smilingly at the old man.</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” she said.</p>

<p>“And the boy,—what’s he doing?”</p>

<p>“He’s studying,” answered Niña Chucha sarcastically,
pointing to Manuel, who sat resting his elbows
upon the dining-room table with his head in
his hands.</p>

<p>And indeed he was devouring one of the serial
issues of a novel by Tárrago y Mateos.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Kate, The Pale Lass—Roberto’s Love Affairs—Military
Punctilio—Wicked Women—Anthropological
Disquisitions</p>

</div>

<p>A month after they were settled in their
new apartment, Christmas came, and, as
there were holidays in all the schools, the
baroness went to fetch her daughter at the Sacred
Heart, returning with her in a carriage.</p>

<p>Niña Chucha undertook to inform Manuel about
the baroness’s daughter, and give him full details.</p>

<p>“She’s a simpleton, understand? A pale, insipid
creature, who looks like a doll.”</p>

<p>Manuel knew her, but he was not sure whether
she would recall him. During the years since he
had seen her she had grown into a winsome girl.
She did not resemble her mother, though, like her,
she was blonde; she must rather take after her
father. She was pale, with correct features, clear
blue eyes, golden eyebrows and lashes, and fair hair
that lacked lustre, yet was quite alluring.</p>

<p>When the schoolgirl arrived, Niña Chucha outdid
herself in demonstrations of affection; the newcomer
recognized Manuel, and this filled him with a deep
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The baroness’s daughter was called Catalina, her
relations from Antwerp called her Kate, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
baroness generally referred to her as La Nena,—the
baby.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Kate the habits of the household
underwent a marked change; the baroness
abandoned her nocturnal excursions and put a check
upon her loose tongue. At table with a sad smile,
she gave ear to the school tales that her daughter related,
without the slightest interest in what she
heard.</p>

<p>There was no harmony between the two characters.
Kate was slow of understanding, but deep;
her mother, on the other hand, was gifted with the
subtlety and cleverness of the moment. The
baroness, at times, grew impatient as Kate spoke on,
and would say, with mingled kindliness and boredom:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a simpleton of a baby I have!”</p>

<p>Since Kate’s coming, Niña Chucha and Manuel
ceased keeping the baroness company in the dining-room.
This did not trouble Manuel in the least,
but the mulattress was quite put out, and she attributed
this arrangement to Kate, whom she considered
a pale, proud doll, cold and heartless.
Manuel, who had no reason for disliking Kate,
found her very simple, very likeable, although lacking
vivacity.</p>

<p>During the Christmas holidays mother and
daughter often went out together on shopping tours;
they were accompanied by Manuel, who returned
loaded with bundles.</p>

<p>One day, shortly after the New Year, when the
baroness, Kate and Manuel had gone to the <i>Apolo</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Theatre to see “Captain Grant’s Nephews,” Manuel
caught sight of Roberto Hasting following them
at a certain distance. As they left the theatre,
Roberto shadowed them; the girl pretended she
had noticed nothing.</p>

<p>The next day, it was snowing. Manuel noticed
Roberto walking across the Plaza del Oriente, seemingly
very much engrossed.</p>

<p>Manuel sought a pretext under which to leave the
house and Roberto at once came over to him.</p>

<p>“Are you in her house?” he asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You must deliver a letter to her.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bring it to you this afternoon. Give it to
her and tell me how she receives it. She’ll not
answer me, I know she’ll not answer me. But you’ll
hand it to her, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>Surely enough, that very afternoon Roberto
walked again through the falling snow, Manuel ran
down, took the letter and dashed back into the house.</p>

<p>At that moment Kate was amusing herself with
her wardrobe. She had a thousand gew-gaws stored
in a number of little boxes; in some, medallions; in
others, small prints, chromographs, gifts from her
schoolmates or the family. Her prayer books were
filled with little pictures and souvenirs.</p>

<p>Manuel, with Roberto’s missive in his pocket,
drew near to the girl like a criminal. La Nena exhibited
all her wealth to him; he swelled with pride.
Manuel scarcely dared to touch the medallions, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
jewels, the thousand things that Kate had treasured
up.</p>

<p>“My uncle gave me this chain,” said the schoolgirl.
“This ring comes from my grandfather.
This pansy I picked in Hyde Park, when I was at
my uncle’s in London.”</p>

<p>Manuel listened to her without a word, ashamed
to have the letter in his pocket. La Nena continued
showing new things to him. She still preserved
her childhood playthings; in her wardrobe
everything was classified with the utmost precision;
each article had its place. In some of the books she
pressed pansies and other flowers, afterwards copying
them and filling in the sketch with water-colours.</p>

<p>Manuel made two or three attempts to bring the
conversation round to Roberto, but his courage
failed him.</p>

<p>All at once, after much clearing of his throat, he
stammered:</p>

<p>“D-do you know ...?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Roberto ... that fair student who used to
board at the other house ... the fellow who was
at the theatre yesterday ... he gave me a letter
for you.”</p>

<p>“For me?” And Kate’s cheeks flushed pink,
while her eyes sparkled with much more than their
usual vivaciousness.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Give it to me.”</p>

<p>“Here it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel handed over the letter and Kate quickly
thrust it into her bosom. She finished arranging her
wardrobe and soon afterward locked herself in her
room. Two days later Kate sent Manuel off with
a note for Roberto, who responded at once with
another for Kate.</p>

<p>One day Kate went with Manuel to his school,
where they were giving a Nativity play, and she was
accompanied both ways by Roberto. They both
were very talkative. The student expatiated upon
his plans. It struck Manuel that this love business
was rather queer. As far as he could see, Roberto
did not say a thing worth hearing, and yet
Kate listened to him with her soul hanging upon
every word.</p>

<p>Roberto, to Kate, was the paragon of respectability.
She spoke to him with calm solemnity,
making no attempt to appear gay or clever; she was
very attentive to all he said.</p>

<p>Manuel became the confidant of Roberto and
Kate. The girl was of immaculate candor and innocence,
and extraordinarily ignorant in matters of
guile. Manuel felt a genuine submissiveness before
that aristocratic, elegant nature; he was filled
with a feeling of inferiority that in no wise troubled
him.</p>

<p>La Nena recounted to Manuel all the things she
had seen in Paris, Brussels, Ghent; she told him
about the parks of London, much to his amazement.
In return, Manuel enlightened Kate as to life in the
underworld of Madrid, filling her in turn with the
utmost astonishment: the cellars, the taverns, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tramps; he described to her the urchins who ran
away from home and slept in the nooks and crannies
of the churches; he spoke to her of the ragamuffins
who pilfer in the laundries; he told her what the
shelters were like....</p>

<p>Manuel possessed a certain gift for imparting his
impressions; he would exaggerate and fill in with
figments of his imagination the gaps left by reality.
La Nena would listen to him in a rapture of interest.</p>

<p>“Oh, how frightful!” she would say. And the
mere thought that this wretched rabble of which
Manuel spoke might rub elbows with her made her
tremble.</p>

<p>The maiden felt a deep repugnance for the common
people; she would not go out on Sundays, so as
to avoid mingling with soldiers and men in
labourers’ smocks. It seemed to her that common
folk must be inherently wicked. As soon as the
street lamps were lighted she preferred to be indoors.</p>

<p>They used to hold their conversations at nightfall
in a room that looked out on to the street, whence
could be seen the Plaza de Oriente, like a wood, and
the Royal Palace, to whose cornices hundreds of
pigeons repaired after winging about all day in
flocks. As a background there was the Casa del
Campo and the horizon which reddened with the
approach of dusk....</p>

<p>After Epiphany, Kate returned to school, whereupon
the old habits were re-established in the household
and the customary disorder reigned.</p>

<p>The first nocturnal sally that the baroness made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was to her Cuban friend, in the company of Manuel.
The baroness and Manuel left after supper. The
Cuban lady lived in the Calle Ancha. They
knocked; a diminutive lackey in blue livery and gold
braid opened the door, and they passed through a
corridor into a lavishly lighted drawing-room,
decorated in cheap, loud taste. In the centre stood
an electric lamp with a cluster of seven or eight
globes; there was a huge sofa upholstered in a very
flowery stuff; two gilt chairs shone beside a
fire-place, upon the marble mantelpiece of which
sat a clock in the form of a ball, a barometer
fashioned like a hammer, a thermometer that represented
a dagger, and sundry other things in
the most absurd shapes. Photographs hung on
every wall.</p>

<p>Only a few disreputable looking women were
present; they humbly rose. The baroness took a
seat, and shortly after, the Cuban entered,—a very
common, brutal woman, dressed in an exceedingly
loud costume, and wearing thick diamonds in her
ears and on her fingers. She took the baroness’s
hand and sat down on a sofa beside her. It could
easily be seen that she desired to flatter her visitor.
The Colonel’s wife was more than a common
woman; she was bestial. She had a prominent jaw,
tiny black eyes and a mouth that bespoke cruelty.
Her features betrayed a certain disturbing, menacing
lubricity; one imagined that such a woman
must be the prey to strange vices,—that she was
capable of crime.</p>

<p>Manuel, from his place in a corner, busied himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with the examination of a photograph album
that he discovered upon a night table.</p>

<p>The wife of the colonel, whom the baroness had
known as a sergeant in Cuba, said that she thought
her younger girl, Lulu, would make her début as a
dancer in a certain Salon; she was giving her the
final lessons.</p>

<p>“Really?” asked the baroness.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed. Mingote got her the contract
and has taken charge of the finishing touches,
as he puts it. Ah, what an accomplished fellow!
He’s in the dining-room now, with some friends.
He’ll be right in. Mingote brought a poet along
who has written a monologue for the dear, clever
little girl. It’s called “Snap-shots.” That’s a
modernistic name, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I should say.”</p>

<p>“It’s supposed to be a girl who goes out into the
streets to take photographs and she meets with a
young blade who approaches her and suggests that
she make him a reproduction or a group, and she replies:
‘Hey there, don’t you dare touch my
chassis!’ Now, isn’t that clever?”</p>

<p>“Exquisite,” declared the baroness, eyeing
Manuel and laughing.</p>

<p>The other women,—distinguished kitchen-maids
to judge from their appearance,—nodded their
heads in token of assent, and smiled sadly.</p>

<p>“Have you many guests in your room?” asked the
baroness.</p>

<p>“As yet no one has come. In the meantime, suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the child dances a little and lets you see what
she can do.”</p>

<p>The Colonel’s wife shouted into the corridor,
whereupon Lulu appeared, attired in a skirt covered
with spangles, and wearing curly bobbed hair. She
was all put out because she had not been able to find
a wrist-watch, and was shrilling in her thin, rasping
voice.</p>

<p>“Let the people inside know,” said the Colonel’s
wife, “that you’ll be here.”</p>

<p>The girl left with the message, and within a short
while the colonel himself appeared,—a respectable
gentleman, with a white beard, who was lame and
leaned upon Mingote’s arm. Behind these two
came a slender young man with fair moustaches and
red cheeks; this was, as the baroness gathered, the
poet. Then followed a long-haired personage, the
piano instructor, on whose arm nestled the elder
daughter of the house,—a fair, buxom wench who
seemed to have escaped from a painting by Rubens.</p>

<p>“Well, which shall we have first?” asked the
Colonel’s wife. “The monologue or the dance?”</p>

<p>“The monologue, the monologue,” was the
general chorus.</p>

<p>“Let’s see, then. Silence.”</p>

<p>The poet, who, to judge from the glitter in his
eyes and the colour of his cheeks, was quite drunk,
smiled amiably.</p>

<p>The little girl began to recite very badly, in the
voice of a hoarse rooster, a heap of coarse banalities
in doggerel that would have brought a blush to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
tanned and weather-beaten cheeks of a coast-guard.
And every one of these banalities wound up with the
refrain</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Don’t you dare touch my chassis!</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the conclusion the colonel offered the opinion
that the verses struck him somewhat ... somewhat,—oh,—just
a wee bit free, and he looked from
one face to another for corroboration. The point
was heatedly discussed. The head of the house
presented his arguments, but Mingote’s rebuttal was
conclusive.</p>

<p>“No, my dear Colonel,” ended the ex-loan shark
excitedly. “The fact is that you feel military
honour too keenly. You regard this from the
standpoint of a soldier.”</p>

<p>The baroness stared at Mingote in amazement,
and could not contain her laughter.</p>

<p>The colonel explained in confidence to Mingote
the reason why the military conception of honour
must perforce be more rigid than that of civilians.
There was the necessity of discipline, there was
order, and the uniform.</p>

<p>After the monologue, the personage with the
flowing hair sat down to the piano and the little
girl began to dance the tango. In this, too, there
was something that required elucidation, and the
Colonel’s wife was eager to have it settled at the
very moment. Of such vital importance was it.
There is a genuinely solemn, transcendental part to
the tango: that hip-movement which the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
scientifically calls “the hinge.” “Now,” asked the
Colonel’s wife, “how is Lulu to perform this part of
the tango,—that is, the hinge? Is she to play it to
the limit, or cover it up a trifle?”</p>

<p>The baroness did not think that the tango should
be so highly accentuated; a little of that movement
would not be so bad. The Colonel’s wife and
Mingote protested, affirming that the public always
prefers the “hinge,” as it is more exciting.</p>

<p>The colonel, despite his military honour, was of
the opinion that the public really did prefer “the
hinge,” but that a little more or less of wiggling was
a minor matter.</p>

<p>Whereupon Mingote, in order to show the little
girl how to do that movement, arose and began to
wiggle his hips in the most grotesque fashion.</p>

<p>The girl imitated his example smilingly, but without
the least enthusiasm. At this juncture the
Colonel’s wife whispered into the baroness’s ear
that only a man could teach a woman the grace and
charm of that movement. The baroness smiled
discreetly.</p>

<p>The diminutive gold-braided lackey entered with
the announcement that Señor Fernández had arrived.
This Fernández must have been a person
of some importance, for the Colonel’s wife arose at
once and prepared to leave.</p>

<p>“Hurry, start the roulette,” said the colonel to
his wife. “And have the lights put on in the large
room. What do you say?” he went on, turning to
the baroness. “Shall we go into the game as partners?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll see later, my dear Colonel. At first I’ll
try my luck alone.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>Lula danced another tango and after a brief while
the Colonel’s wife returned.</p>

<p>“You may come in,” she said.</p>

<p>The old kitchen-maids got up from their chairs
and, crossing the corridor, entered a large room
with three balcony windows. There were two
tables, one of them with a roulette wheel and the
other bare.</p>

<p>The three old women, the baroness, the colonel
and his two daughters sat down before the roulette
table, where the banker and the two payers were
already seated.</p>

<p>“<i>Faites vos jeux</i>,” said the croupier with the impassivity
of an automaton.</p>

<p>The white sphere danced around the wheel and
before it came to a stop the croupier pronounced:</p>

<p>“<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>”</p>

<p>The two payers placed their rakes upon the cloth
to prevent the laying of any further bets. “No
more bets,” they repeated, at the same time, in a
monotonous voice.</p>

<p>Gradually the room was filling with people, and
the seats around the table were taken.</p>

<p>Beside the baroness a man of about forty had
taken a chair. He was tall, robust, broad-shouldered,
with black, kinky hair and white teeth.</p>

<p>“Why, my boy, you here?” exclaimed the baroness.</p>

<p>“And how about you?” he retorted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a second or third cousin of the baroness;
his name was Horacio.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell me that you invariably retired
at nine?” asked the baroness.</p>

<p>“It’s only an accident that I came here. It’s the
first time.”</p>

<p>“Bah.”</p>

<p>“I assure you it is. Shall we go in it together?”</p>

<p>“That is not a bad idea.”</p>

<p>They pooled their money and continued playing.
Horacio played according to the baroness’s directions.
They were lucky and won. Gradually the
parlor became thronged with a variegated, exotic
crowd. There were two well-known members of
the aristocracy, a bull-fighter, soldiers. Several
women and their daughters were pressed closely
around the tables.</p>

<p>Manuel caught sight of Irene, Doña Violante’s
granddaughter, beside an old gentleman with his
hair pasted down. The man was playing heavily.
His fingers were fairly concealed by rings set with
huge stones.</p>

<p>Seated upon a divan near Manuel, a very pale
and emaciated old gentleman with a white beard
was conversing with a beardless youth who looked
bored.</p>

<p>“Have you withdrawn from the game so soon?”
asked the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes. I withdrew because my money ran out.
Otherwise I’d have kept on playing until they found
me lying dead across the green cloth. To me, this
is the only life. I’m like La Valiente. She knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
me, and she says to me now and then: ‘Let’s go in it
together, Marquis?’—‘I won’t bring you bad luck,’
is my answer.”</p>

<p>“Who is La Valiente?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see her soon, when the baccarat begins.”</p>

<p>A light was turned on over the table.</p>

<p>An old man with moustaches like a musketeer’s
arose with a deck of cards in his hands and leaned
against the edge of the table.</p>

<p>“Who deals?” asked the old man.</p>

<p>“Fifty duros,” murmured one.</p>

<p>“Sixty.”</p>

<p>“A hundred.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and fifty duros.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred,” shrieked a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>“That’s La Valiente,” said the marquis.</p>

<p>Manuel contemplated her with curiosity. She
was between thirty and forty; she wore a tailor-made
costume and a Frégoli hat. She was very
dark, with an olive complexion and beautiful black
eyes. She would gamble until she could hardly
see, and then go out into the corridors for a smoke.
She brimmed over with energy and intelligence.
They said she carried a revolver. She had no
use for men and fell passionately in love with
women. Her most recent conquest had been the
colonel’s elder daughter, the buxom blonde, whom
she dominated. At times she was favored by the
most unbelievable luck, and to assuage her pangs
of passion, she played and won in most insolent
fashion.</p>

<p>“And that fellow who never plays, yet is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
here,—who is he?” asked the young man, pointing
to a coarse looking old fellow of about seventy, with
dyed moustaches.</p>

<p>“He’s a moneylender who, I believe, is the partner
of the Colonel’s wife. When I was Governor
of La Coruña he was waiting trial for some piece
of smuggling or other that he had perpetrated at
the Customs House. They removed him from
office, and then gave him a commission in the
Philippines.”</p>

<p>“As a reward?”</p>

<p>“My dear man, everybody has to live,” replied
the marquis. “I don’t know what he did in the
Philippines, but he was in court several times, and
when he was free they gave him a position in Cuba.”</p>

<p>“They wanted him to make a study of the Spanish
colonial régime,” suggested the youth.</p>

<p>“Doubtless. He got into a few scrapes over
there, too, until he returned and went into the
money-lending business. They say now that he
is worth not less than a million pesetas.”</p>

<p>“The deuce, he is!”</p>

<p>“He’s a serious, modest fellow. Up to a few
years ago he lived with a certain Paca, who was the
proprietress of a dyer’s shop on the Calle de Hortaleza,
and on Sundays they’d both go out to the
suburbs like a poor couple. This Paca died, and
now he lives alone. He’s shy and humble; many
a time he himself goes out and does the buying, and
then cooks his own meal. His old secretary is a
really interesting chap. When it comes to forgery
he can’t be beaten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel listened most attentively.</p>

<p>“That’s what you really can call a man,” said
the marquis, eyeing the secretary closely.</p>

<p>The man they were watching,—a person with a
red, pointed beard and a mocking air, turned around
and saluted the speaker affably.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, Master,” said the marquis to him.</p>

<p>“You call him Master?” asked the young man.</p>

<p>“That’s what everybody calls him.”</p>

<p>Lulu, the colonel’s daughter, and two girl friends
of hers passed by the marquis and his young companion.</p>

<p>“How pretty they are,” commented the marquis.</p>

<p>The place took on the mixed appearance of a
brothel and a high-class den of vice. There was
here neither the anxious silence of the gambling-house
nor the confused clamour of a brothel: people
gambled and loved with discretion. As the Colonel’s
wife put it, this was a very modernistic
gathering.</p>

<p>On the divans the girls were conversing very animatedly
with the men; they were discussing and
studying out combinations for the game....</p>

<p>“All this delights me,” said the marquis with his
pale smile.</p>

<p>The baroness was beginning to feel somewhat
nauseated and wished to be going.</p>

<p>“I’m off. Will you come along with me, Horacio?”
she asked of her cousin.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I’ll accompany you.”</p>

<p>The baroness arose, then Horacio; Manuel joined
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a mob of creatures, eh?” said the baroness
with that peculiar, ingenuous laugh of hers, once
they were in the street.</p>

<p>“That’s amorality, as they say nowadays,” replied
Horacio. “We Spaniards aren’t immoral.
The fact is that we simply have no notion of
morality. When I got up to take a little air, the
colonel said to me, ‘You see, you see, they’ve cut
down my pay: reduced it from eighty to seventy.
So clearly enough I have to find other sources of income.
That’s why soldiers’ daughters have to become
dancers ... and all the rest.’”</p>

<p>“Did he say that to you? What a barbarian!”</p>

<p>“What? Does that shock you? Not me. It’s
just a natural and necessary consequence of our
race. We’ve degenerated. We are a race of the
lowest class.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because we are. All you’ve got to do is look
around you. Did you see the head on the colonel’s
shoulders?”</p>

<p>“No. Has he anything in his head?” asked the
baroness jokingly.</p>

<p>“Not a thing. The brains of a Papuan.
Morality is found only in superior races. The English
say that Wellington is superior to Napoleon because
Wellington fought through a sense of duty and
Napoleon for glory. The idea of duty never penetrates
into craniums like the colonel’s. Talk to a
Mandingo of duty. Nothing doing. Oh, anthropology
is a most instructive science. I explain everything
by anthropological laws.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>They were passing by the Café de Varela.</p>

<p>“Shall we go in here?” asked her cousin.</p>

<p>“Let’s go.”</p>

<p>The three sat down around a table, each asked
for a favourite drink and the baroness’s cousin continued
his speech.</p>

<p>The man was a queer type; he spoke an almost
incomprehensible Andalusian dialect, with a guttural
<i>h</i>; he had enough money to subsist upon and with
this, and a minor position in a ministry, he managed
to get along. He dwelt in a very carefully regulated
disorder, reading Spencer in English and
changing his mode of life at certain seasons.</p>

<p>Like the whimsical fellow he was, he had been
sunk for the past four or five years in the swampy
fields of sociology and anthropology. He was
convinced that intellectually he was an Anglo-Saxon,
who need not be occupied with questions
pertaining to Spain or to any other nation of the
South.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” continued Horacio as he filled his
glass with beer, “I explain everything, down to the
tiniest detail, by social or biological laws. This
morning, as I was getting up, I heard my landlady
conversing with the baker about the rise in the cost
of bread. ‘Why has bread gone up?’ she asked him.
‘I don’t know,’ he answered. ‘They say that the
harvest is good.’ ‘Well, then?’ ‘I don’t know.’
I went off to the office at the precise hour, with
English punctuality; there was nobody there; that’s
the Spanish custom. So I asked myself, How does
it happen that bread goes up if there’s a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
harvest? And I hit upon the explanation which I
think will convince you. You know that there are
tiny cells in the brain.”</p>

<p>“How should I know anything about that?” retorted
the baroness, dipping a biscuit into her chocolate.</p>

<p>“Well, take my word for it, there are cells, and,
according to the opinion of the physiologists, each
cell has its own particular function; one serves for
one thing, another for another. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Now just recall that in Spain there
are some thirteen millions of inhabitants who can
neither read nor write. Do you follow me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Of course.”</p>

<p>“Very well. That cell which in educated persons
is employed in attempts at understanding and thinking,
is here left unemployed by thirteen millions of
the population. That energy which they should expend
in discussion, they waste in bestial instincts.
As a consequence, crime increases, so does sexual appetite,
and with the increase of sexual appetite comes
an increase in the consumption of food, whereupon
bread goes up.”</p>

<p>The baroness could not help bursting into laughter
at her cousin’s explanation.</p>

<p>“That’s no mere fancy,” replied Horacio, “it’s the
God’s honest truth.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t doubt it, but the news strikes me
funny.” Manuel, too, had to laugh.</p>

<p>“Where did you pick up this kid?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s the son of a woman we knew. What does
your science tell you of him?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see. Remove your cap.”</p>

<p>Manuel removed his cap.</p>

<p>“He’s a Celt,” proclaimed Horacio. “Fine race.
Facial angle open; broad forehead; not much
jaw....”</p>

<p>“And what does all this signify?” queried Manuel.</p>

<p>“In the final analysis, nothing. Have you any
money?”</p>

<p>“I? Not a button.”</p>

<p>“Then let me tell you this: since you have no
money, and aren’t a man of prey, and can’t use your
intelligence, even though you may have some, which
I believe is the case, you’ll probably die in a hospital.”</p>

<p>“How rude!” exclaimed the baroness. “Don’t
talk like that to the boy.”</p>

<p>Manuel greeted the prognostication with
laughter; it seemed very comical to him.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, I,” went on Horacio, “have
no fear of dying in a hospital. Look at my head;
see that jaw; tokens of a most brutal instinct of acquisitiveness.
I’m a Berber by race,—a Euro-African.
And fortunately, I may add, I have been
influenced by the ideas of Lord Bacon’s pragmatic
philosophy. If it weren’t for that, I’d now be
dancing tangoes in Cuba or Puerto Rico.”</p>

<p>“So that, thanks to this Lord, you’re a civilized
man?”</p>

<p>“Relatively civilized. I don’t pretend to compare
myself to an Englishman. Can I be certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that I’m an Aryan? Am I, perhaps, a Celt or
Saxon? I don’t deceive myself. I am of an inferior
race. What am I going to do about it? I wasn’t
born in Manchester, but in Camagüey, and I was
brought up in Málaga. Just imagine that!”</p>

<p>“And what has that to do with the case?”</p>

<p>“Everything, my dear. Civilization comes with
rainfall. It is in the moist, rainy countries that the
most civilized types are nurtured, and the most
beautiful as well. Types such as your daughter,
with those blue eyes of hers, her fair complexion
and her blond hair.”</p>

<p>“And how about me? What am I?” asked the
baroness. “A little of what you said before?”</p>

<p>“A tiny bit Berber, you mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I think that was it. A tiny bit Berber,
eh?”</p>

<p>“In character, perhaps, but not in type. You’re
pure Aryan; your ancestors must have come from
India, from the meseta of Pamir or the valley of
Cabul, but they did not pass through Africa. You
may rest easy on that score.”</p>

<p>The baroness eyed her cousin with a somewhat
enigmatical expression. After a short while the
cousins and Manuel left the café.</p>

<h3 id="I_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Berber Feels Profoundly Anglo-Saxon—The Mephistophelian
Mingote—Cogolludo—Kate’s Departure</p>

</div>

<p>Ever since the baroness and the sociologist had
met at the garrulous gathering of the
Colonel’s wife, Horacio began to frequent
the baroness’s house and deliver courses in anthropology
and sociology in the dining-room. Manuel
had no idea as to what those sciences might be in the
original, but as translated into Adalusian by the
baroness’s cousin, they were certainly picturesque.
Manuel and Niña Chucha listened to the Berber
with intense interest, and at times offered objections,
which he answered, if not with very scientific arguments
at least with an abundance of wit.</p>

<p>Cousin Horacio got into the habit of staying for
supper and finally remained after supper as well.
Niña Chucha favoured the Berber perhaps through
racial affinity, and laughed, showing her white teeth,
whenever Don Sergio came on a visit.</p>

<p>The situation was compromising because the
baroness cared not a whit about anything. After
having used Mingote, she sent him away two or
three times without so much as a céntimo. The
agent began to threaten, and one day he came resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
to raise a scandal. He spoke of the forging
of Manuel’s certificates, and hinted that this would
cost the baroness a term in jail. She replied that
the responsibility of the forgery rested with
Mingote,—that she would find some one to protect
her, and that, in case justice should intervene, the
one to go to jail would be he.</p>

<p>Mingote threatened, shrieked, shouted at the top
of his lungs, and who should come walking in at the
height of the dispute but Horacio.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? You can hear the noise
from the street,” he said.</p>

<p>“This man is insulting me,” cried the baroness.</p>

<p>Horacio seized Mingote by the scruff of the neck
and shot him through the doorway. Mingote dissolved
into curses, introducing Horacio’s mother
into the altercation, whereupon the latter, forgetting
Lord Bacon, felt the Berber in his blood, raised his
foot and planted the toe of his boot upon Mingote’s
buttocks. The agent shouted even more loudly,
whereupon the Berber again caressed with his foot
the roundest part of Mingote’s person.</p>

<p>The baroness foresaw that the agent would need
time to take his revenge; she did not believe that he
would dare to mention the forgery of the documents
involving Manuel’s paternity, for his fingers would
be caught in the same door. He would, however, be
likely to inform Don Sergio of cousin Horacio’s
presence in the house. Before he could do this,
she wrote the merchant a letter asking for money
with which to pay off certain debts. She sent
Manuel with the missive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The chalky old fellow read the letter and grew uneasy.</p>

<p>“See here, tell your ... mistress she’ll have to
wait. I, too, have to wait very often.”</p>

<p>The baroness was furious at this reply.</p>

<p>“The coarse old brute! The vile beast! It’s all
my fault for having bothered with the disgusting old
duffer. Just wait till he comes. I’ll tell him what’s
what.”</p>

<p>But Don Sergio did not show up, and the baroness,
who surmised what had taken place, moved to a
cheaper house in order to economize. Niña
Chucha, Manuel and the three dogs were thus transferred
to a third-floor apartment on the Calle del
Ave María.</p>

<p>Here the idyll begun between the baroness and
Horacio resumed its course, despite the fact that
the latter, because of his Anglo-Saxon, phlegmatic
temperament, or because of the low esteem in
which he held women—a patrimony of the southern
races—attached little importance to flirtations of
this kind.</p>

<p>From time to time, in order to meet the expenses
of the house, the baroness would sell or
pawn a piece of furniture; but, with the disorder
which reigned in that household, the money did not
last long.</p>

<p>When they had been settled for about a month in
the Calle del Ave María, Don Sergio appeared one
morning boiling with indignation. The baroness
refused to receive him, and sent the servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
maid to say that she was out. The old man went
away and that afternoon wrote the baroness a
letter.</p>

<p>Mingote had not “peached.” Don Sergio
fumed; it did not appear seemly to him that Horacio
should spend his days and nights in the baroness’s
home; he did not mind an occasional visit from her
cousin, but his assiduity,—that was the rub. The
baroness showed the letter to her cousin; he, who
doubtless was just hunting for some pretext under
which he might escape, bethought himself of Lord
Bacon, suddenly felt the Anglo-Saxon in him rise,—the
Aryan, man of morals,—and ceased his visits to
the home of the baroness.</p>

<p>The baroness, who was suffering from the final
flush of romanticism that comes with the Indian
summer of youth, sank into despair, addressed
epistles to the gallant, but he continued to feel
Anglo-Saxon and Aryan, ever mindful of Lord
Bacon.</p>

<p>In the meantime Don Sergio, finding that his
letter had produced no results, returned to his mission
and came again to the house.</p>

<p>“My dear Paquita, what can possibly be the
trouble with you?” he asked, gazing upon her altered
features.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ve caught the grippe, my head feels
so heavy. I have aches all over my body. Here
you see me, utterly abandoned. It is God’s will, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>Don Sergio listened silently to the whirlwind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
words and wails with which the baroness tried to
clear herself of blame; then he said:</p>

<p>“This sort of life can’t go on. You must introduce
some method, some semblance of order.
Things simply can’t go on like this.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve been thinking,” answered
the baroness. “I understand well enough that this
sort of life isn’t for me. I’ll go back to another
house at twelve duros.”</p>

<p>“And the furniture?”</p>

<p>“I’ll sell it.”</p>

<p>How was she to tell him that she had already sold
it?</p>

<p>“No, I....” The chalky fellow was about to
speak like a crafty merchant, but he did not dare.
“Then again,” he went on, “these frequent visits of
your cousin aren’t at all nice.”</p>

<p>“But what can I do if he pursues me,” murmured
the baroness in a plaintive voice. “That man is
simply mad over me. I know that such a passion is
rare. A woman of my years....”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like that, Paquita.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, there you are. He follows me like
a shadow. But you’ll see, now; I’ll see that he
never comes here any more.”</p>

<p>“Never come! He certainly will come, until you
tell him not to, in so many words....”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve told him, and that’s why
he’ll never come any more.”</p>

<p>“All the better, then.”</p>

<p>The baroness glared at Don Sergio in indignation,
and then assumed an air of deep contrition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Sergio brought forward his plans for regeneration,
and was of the opinion that Paquita
ought to get rid of Niña Chucha, whom the chalky
old gentleman detested most cordially. But the
baroness protested that she loved the girl as her own
child—almost as much as, if not more than, the
dogs, which were the very apple of her eyes.</p>

<p>The baroness suddenly sat up on the sofa.</p>

<p>“I have a plan,” she said to Don Sergio. “Tell
me what you think of it. In yesterday’s <i>Imparcial</i>
I saw advertised a country house in Cogolludo, with
a garden and orchard, at fifty duros per annum.
I imagine that it must be a pretty bad place; but, at
least it’s a bit of land and a place to live, and even a
tiny cabin is enough for me. I could be fitting up
the cabin gradually. What do you think of the suggestion,
Don Sergio?”</p>

<p>“But why should you leave this place?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to tell you,” answered the
baroness. “But that fellow simply persecutes me
with his insistent attentions.” And she related a
heap of lies. The good lady solaced herself with
the illusion that her cousin was pursuing her relentlessly,
and all the letters that she had written to him
she represented as having been written by him to
her.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” she went on, “I don’t have to go to
the end of the world to avoid that ridiculous troubador.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no train to Cogolludo. You’re
going to be awfully bored.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I’ll simply shut myself up in my hut like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a saint, and devote myself to watering my garden
and tending my flowers ... but I am so unlucky
that I’m certain some one must have rented the
place by now.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m sure not. But I really don’t see the
necessity of your leaving. The boy won’t be able to
attend school.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t need it any more. He’ll continue his
studies independently.”</p>

<p>“Very well. We’ll rent the house.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for otherwise that low fellow will keep on
pestering me. I wish they’d drag him off to jail and
hang him! Ah, Don Sergio! When will Carlos
VII come? I don’t believe in liberty or constitutional
guarantees for rascals.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, woman. This will all straighten
itself out in due season. Take heart, and make
haste.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Don Sergio. You were always such a
strong man. A rock.... A Tarpeian rock.
And you don’t know where to keep your money.
Keep me in mind! You know that I’m a most
orderly creature and that I neither stint nor
squander.”</p>

<p>This was great virtue of the baroness—she knew
herself thoroughly.</p>

<p>Once the decision was reached to go to Cogolludo,
Niña Chucha and Manuel began to pack the
furniture. In the midst of the packing, however,
the mulattress remarked that she was very
sorry, but that she would remain at a house in
Madrid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, my dear girl, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>The servant, annoyed by these questions, confessed
that a young gentleman from South America,
a little <i>rastacouère</i> who felt homesick for his cocoa-nut
trees, had offered her a place as housekeeper in
his apartment.</p>

<p>The baroness did not dare speak of morality, and
the sole bit of advice that she offered was, that if the
South American were not to content himself simply
with her services as housekeeper, she had better
watch out for her interests; but the girl was no fool
and, as she said, had already taken all precautions to
land safely, on both her feet.</p>

<p>Manuel was left alone in the house to finish the
tasks necessary to the removal. One afternoon, as
he was returning from the Estación del Mediodía,
he came upon Mingote, who, the moment he spied
Manuel, ran after him.</p>

<p>“Where are you rushing?” he panted. “Any one
would have thought that you were trying to get
away from me.”</p>

<p>“I? What nonsense! I’m very glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>“I, too.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to going into this café? I’ll
pay for the drinks.”</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>They walked into the Café de Zaragoza.
Mingote ordered two coffees, note paper, pen and
ink.</p>

<p>“Would you mind writing something that I’ll dictate
to you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that depends upon what it is.”</p>

<p>“All I want you to do is to write a letter telling
me that you’re not Sergio Figueroa but Manuel
Alcázar.”</p>

<p>“And what do you want me to write that for?
Don’t you know it as well as I do?” asked Manuel,
innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a plan I’m working on.”</p>

<p>“And what is there in it for me?”</p>

<p>“Thirty duros.”</p>

<p>“You mean it? Hand ’em over!”</p>

<p>“No, not now. When the deal is put through.”</p>

<p>Finding Manuel so favourably inclined, Mingote
told him that if he could manage to steal the forged
documents of his paternity from the baroness and
hand them over to him, he’d add twenty more duros
to the thirty already offered.</p>

<p>“I have the papers put away,” said Manuel. “If
you’ll wait here a moment I’ll bring them to you at
once.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll be waiting here. What a sorry
idiot this boy is,” thought Mingote. “He really
imagines that I’m going to give him fifty duros.
The fool!”</p>

<p>An hour went by; then another. No Manuel
was forthcoming.</p>

<p>“Can the idiot have been myself?” exclaimed
Mingote. “No doubt about it. Can that damned
kid have fooled me?”</p>

<p>While Mingote stood there waiting, the baroness
and Manuel had taken the train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>They reached Cogolludo and the baroness was
bitterly disappointed. She had thought that the
town would be a sort of gipsy hamlet, and instead
she found an ugly village in the midst of a plain.</p>

<p>The house she had rented was on the outskirts of
the village; it was spacious, with a blue door, three
tiny windows peeping on to the road, and a poultry-yard
in the rear. It must have been standing vacant
for the past ten years. On the day after they arrived
the baroness and Manuel swept and cleaned
and dusted. The poor woman bitterly lamented her
action.</p>

<p>“Oh, God in heaven, what a house!” she wailed.
“What ever in the world did we come here for?
And such a village! I had caught a passing glimpse
of one or more towns in Spain, but in the North,
where there are trees. This is so dry, so barren!”</p>

<p>Manuel was in his glory; the land near the
house produced only nettles and dwarf elders, but he
imagined that he could transform that patch of
earth, so parched and stifled with noxious growths,
into a flourishing garden. He set to work with a
right good will.</p>

<p>First he weeded the ground and then burned all
the grass of the garden.</p>

<p>Then he ploughed up the earth with a goad, and
planted chick-peas, kidney-beans and potatoes indiscriminately,
without troubling to find out whether
it was the proper time for sowing. Then he spent
hour after hour drawing water from an exceedingly
deep well that was situated in the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
garden; and as the rope scraped his skin, and, moreover,
the soil would be dry within a half hour of
watering, he contrived a sort of winch with the aid
of which it took him half an hour to draw a bucket
of water.</p>

<p>After they had been there a fortnight, the
baroness engaged a servant, and when the house was
thoroughly cleaned, she went off to Madrid, took
Kate from school, and brought her to Cogolludo.</p>

<p>Kate, being of a practical turn of mind, filled
several flower-pots with earth and planted various
flowers in them.</p>

<p>“Why do you do that?” asked Manuel, “since the
whole place will be covered with blossoms in a short
time?”</p>

<p>“I want to have my own,” answered the girl.</p>

<p>A month passed, and despite Manuel’s exertions,
not a seed sown by him showed any signs of sprouting.
Only a few geraniums and some garlic planted
by the servant grew admirably, despite the dryness.</p>

<p>Kate’s pots likewise prospered; during the height
of the day’s heat she would take them indoors and
water them. Manuel, beholding the ignominious
failure of his horticultural efforts, devoted himself
energetically to the extermination of the wasps, who
took shelter in large honeycombs of cells symmetrically
arranged, hidden in the interstices of the tiles.</p>

<p>He waged a war to the death against the wasps,
but could not conquer them; it seemed that they had
conceived a hatred for him; they launched such
furious attacks against him that most of the time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
had to beat a retreat, and was exposed to the danger
of falling from the roof riddled with stings.</p>

<p>Kate’s diversions were of a less strenuous, more
pacific nature. She had arranged her room in perfect
order. She knew how to beautify everything.
With the bed covered by a white quilt and hidden by
curtains, the flower-pots on the window ledge already
showing signs of sprouting, her wardrobe, and
the chromographs on the blue walls, her bedchamber
assumed an aspect of charming grace.</p>

<p>Then she was an affable, even-tempered lass.</p>

<p>She had found a wounded cat in the fields, which
some urchins had been chasing with stones. She
picked it up, at the risk of being scratched, took care
of it, and nursed it back to health. Now the cat followed
her wherever she went and would stay only
with her.</p>

<p>Manuel obeyed La Nena blindly, and felt, moreover,
an intense satisfaction in this obedience.
He looked upon her as a paragon of perfection, yet
despite this, not even in his innermost self, did it ever
occur to him to fall in love with her. Perhaps he
considered her too good for him, too beautiful.
Manuel experienced the paradoxical tendency of all
imaginative men who believe that they love perfection
and then fall in love with imperfection.</p>

<p>The summer went by pleasantly. The chalky old
fellow came twice to Cogolludo, and was seemingly
content. At the end of August, however, the
pesetas that the baroness regularly received did not
put in their appearance.</p>

<p>She wrote several times to Don Sergio, pleading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
again the persecution of which she was the victim,
for in this wise she satisfied both her vanity and the
self-conceit of “old Cromwell.” But Don Sergio
did not fall into the trap.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about it; Mingote had
informed. For a while the baroness bided her time,
obtaining money on one pretext or another, piling up
debts. One day, toward the beginning of autumn,
the house agent appeared, requesting her to vacate
the premises, as they had not paid the rent in
Madrid. The baroness broke into insults, and tore
to pieces the character of Don Sergio; the guard,
however, said that his orders were not to permit the
removal of the furniture before he was paid the rent.
The baroness was overwhelmed to think that her
daughter would learn of her wicked life; she
calculated the value of the furniture, which even in
Madrid, with the forced sale of some and the pawning
of other pieces, had been reduced to those
articles which were strictly indispensable, and made
up her mind to leave them behind and flee from
Cogolludo.</p>

<p>One afternoon when they left the village for a
stroll, the baroness explained the situation to Kate,
who received the news in utter confusion.</p>

<p>“Shall we go to Madrid?” she concluded.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” said Kate.</p>

<p>“This very moment?”</p>

<p>“This very moment.”</p>

<p>“It’s cold. It’s beginning to drizzle.”</p>

<p>The railway station was in a nearby village.
Manuel knew the way. The three of them strode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
along amid low hillocks; they met nobody. Kate
was still somewhat upset.</p>

<p>“We must look pretty queer,” said the baroness.</p>

<p>About an hour and a half after having left the
village, suddenly, around a bend in the road, they
sighted the semaphore of the railroad,—a white
disc that looked like a gaunt spectre. A barely perceptible
breeze was blowing. Soon they heard from
a distance the shrill whistle of the locomotive; then
came gleams of the red and white lanterns on the
engine, which grew rapidly in the darkness; the
earth trembled, the cars thundered by with an infernal
roar, a puff of white smoke rolled up, shot
through with luminous incandescencies, and fell in a
shower of sparks to the ground. The train sped on,
leaving two lanterns, one red and the other green,
dancing in the gloom of the night, until they, too,
were engulfed in the darkness. By the time they
entered the station the three were exhausted. They
waited several hours, and on the morning of the
following day they arrived in Madrid.</p>

<p>The baroness was worried. They went to a
lodging-house; they were asked whether they had
any luggage; the baroness answered no, and could
find no pretext or explanation. They were told that
they could not be accommodated without luggage,
unless they paid in advance, and the baroness left in
shame. Thence they proceeded to the house of a
friend, but she had moved away. Neither did they
know Horacio’s whereabouts. The baroness was
compelled to pawn Kate’s watch and the trio took
rooms in a third-class hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>On the fourth day their money gave out. The
baroness had lost her self-composure, and her
features betrayed her weariness and discouragement.</p>

<p>She wrote a humble letter to her brother-in-law,
begging hospitality for herself and daughter. The
answer was slow in coming. The baroness hid
from Kate, to cry her fill.</p>

<p>The proprietress of the hotel presented their account;
the baroness entreated her to wait a few days
until a certain letter should come, but the landlady,
who would not have been perturbed by the request
made in some other form, imagined from the tones
employed by the baroness that deception was afoot,
so she answered that she would not wait, and that,
if on the next day she were not paid, she would
notify the police.</p>

<p>Kate, seeing that her mother was more troubled
than ever, asked her what was the matter. The
baroness explained the dire straits in which they
found themselves.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see the ambassador of my country,”
declared Kate with determination.</p>

<p>“You, alone? I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>“No, let Manuel accompany me.”</p>

<p>The two went off to the Embassy; they entered
through a wide doorway. Kate handed her card to
an attendant and was admitted at once. Manuel,
seated on a bench, waited for fifteen minutes. At
the end of this time the maiden came out in company
of a venerable old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw her to the door and spoke to a uniformed
lackey.</p>

<p>The lackey opened the door of a carriage that
stood opposite the entrance and remained standing
with his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>Kate bade the old gentleman good-bye. Then she
said to Manuel:</p>

<p>“Come along.”</p>

<p>She stepped into the carriage, followed by the
astounded Manuel.</p>

<p>“Everything’s all arranged,” said the girl to
Manuel. “The ambassador has telephoned to the
hotel requesting them to send the bill to the Embassy.”</p>

<p>Manuel noticed on this occasion, and in later
years more than once corroborated the observation,
that women accustomed from childhood to submit
and to conceal their desires, possess, when their
hidden energies are brought into play, a most extraordinary
power.</p>

<p>The baroness received the news in astonishment
and in an access of tenderness showered kisses upon
Kate, weeping bitterly as she did so.</p>

<p>Some days later there came an answer from the
baroness’s brother-in-law, together with a check
covering the expenses of the journey.</p>

<p>Despite what the baroness had promised Manuel,
he knew that he would not be taken along. It was
natural. The baroness bought some clothes for La
Nena and herself.</p>

<p>One autumn afternoon mother and daughter departed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Manuel accompanied them to the station.</p>

<p>The baroness was deeply depressed to think of
leaving Madrid; La Nena was, as always, apparently
serene.</p>

<p>During the ride none of the three spoke a
word.</p>

<p>They stepped out of the carriage into the waiting-room;
there was a trunk to be registered; Manuel
saw to it. Then they went to the platform and took
seats in a second-class coach. Roberto, pale, was
pacing up and down the platform.</p>

<p>The baroness promised the boy that they would
return.</p>

<p>The station bell rang. Manuel stepped into the
coach.</p>

<p>“Better be getting off,” said the baroness. “The
train is about to start.”</p>

<p>Manuel offered his hand timidly to La Nena.</p>

<p>“Embrace her,” said her mother.</p>

<p>Manuel scarcely dared to put his arms around the
maiden’s waist. The baroness kissed him upon both
cheeks.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Manuel,” she said, wiping a tear.</p>

<p>The train started; La Nena waved her hand from
the window; one car after another rumbled along
the tracks; the locomotive gathered speed. Manuel
grew heavy hearted. On sped the train, whistling
through the fields, as Manuel raised his hands to his
eyes and felt that he was weeping.</p>

<p>Roberto clutched his arm.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that you?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“They were very good to me,” commented
Manuel, sadly.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Sandoval—Sánchez Gómez’s “Toads”—Jacob and Jesús.</p>

</div>

<p>Manuel and Roberto left the station together.</p>

<p>“Are you going to begin your old life
all over again?” asked Roberto. “Why don’t you
make up your mind once and for all to go to work?”</p>

<p>“Where? I’m no good at hunting for a job.
Do you know anything I could get? Some printing
shop....”</p>

<p>“Would you be willing to go in as an apprentice,
without any pay?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What will it be?”</p>

<p>“If you’ve no objections, I’ll take you this instant
to the head of a certain newspaper. Come along.”</p>

<p>They ascended to the Plaza de San Marcial, then
went on through the Calle de los Reyes to the Calle
de San Bernardo; reaching the Calle del Pez they
entered a house. They knocked at a door on the
main floor; a scrawny woman appeared, informing
them that the gentleman whom Roberto had called
for was asleep and had left word not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>“I’m a friend of his,” answered Roberto. “I’ll
wake him up.”</p>

<p>The two made their way through a corridor to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
dark room that reeked foully with iodoform.
Roberto knocked.</p>

<p>“Sandoval!”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? What’s the matter?”
shouted a powerful voice.</p>

<p>“It’s I; Roberto.”</p>

<p>There came the sounds of a man in his underclothes
stepping out of bed and opening the shutters
of the balcony; then they could see him return to
his spacious bed.</p>

<p>He was a man of about forty, chubby-cheeked,
corpulent, with a black beard.</p>

<p>“What’s the time?” he asked, stretching his
limbs.</p>

<p>“Ten.”</p>

<p>“The devil, you say! As early as that? I’m
glad you woke me; I’ve so many things to do.
Shout down the corridor for me, will you.”</p>

<p>Roberto yelled a sonorous “Eh!” whereupon a
painted girl walked into the room in evident ill-humor.</p>

<p>“Go fetch my clothes,” ordered Sandoval, and
with an effort he sat up in bed, yawned stupidly and
began to scratch his arms.</p>

<p>“What brings you here?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Well, you remember you told me the other day
that you needed a boy in the office. I’ve brought
you this one.”</p>

<p>“Why, man, I’ve already hired another.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s nothing to be done.”</p>

<p>“But I believe they need one at the printing shop.”</p>

<p>“Sánchez Gómez doesn’t think much of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll talk to him. He can’t refuse me this.”</p>

<p>“Will you forget?”</p>

<p>“No, no I’ll not.”</p>

<p>“Bah! Write him; that would be better.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll write him.”</p>

<p>“No. This very moment. Just a few words.”</p>

<p>As they spoke, Manuel observed the room with
intense curiosity; it was unbelievably upset and
filthy. The furniture comprised—the bed, a commode,
an iron washstand, a shelf and two broken
chairs. The commode and the shelf were heaped
with papers and books whose binding was falling
away. On the chairs lay petticoats and dresses.
The floor was littered with cigar stubs, scraps of
newspaper and pieces of absorbent cotton that
had been used in some cure or other. Under the
table reposed an iron wash bowl that had been
converted into a brasier and was full of ashes and
cinders.</p>

<p>When the servant-girl returned with Sandoval’s
shirt and outer garments he got up in his drawers
and began a search amidst his papers for a cake of
soap, finally locating it. He washed himself in the
basin of the washstand, which was brimming with
dirty water wherein swam wisps of woman’s hair.</p>

<p>“Would you mind throwing out the water?”
asked the journalist humbly of the maid.</p>

<p>“Throw it out yourself,” she snarled, leaving the
room.</p>

<p>Sandoval went out into the corridor in his drawers,
basin in hand, then returned, washed, and began
to dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Here and there on the books lay a grimy comb,
a broken toothbrush reddened with blood from
gums, a collar edged with dirt, a rice-powder box
full of dents with the puff black and hardened.</p>

<p>After Sandoval had dressed he became transformed
in Manuel’s eyes; he took on an air of distinction
and elegance. He wrote the letter that was
asked of him, whereupon Roberto and Manuel left
the house.</p>

<p>“He’s in there cursing away at us,” commented
Roberto.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s as lazy as a Turk. He’ll forgive
anything except being made to work.”</p>

<p>Again they found themselves on the Calle de San
Bernardo, and entered a lane that cut across. They
paused before a tiny structure that jutted out from
the line of the other buildings.</p>

<p>“This is the printing-shop,” said Roberto.</p>

<p>Manuel looked about him. Not a sign, no lettering,
no indication whatsoever that this was a printery.
Roberto thrust aside a little gate and they
walked into a gloomy cellar that received its scanty
light through the doorway leading to a dank, dirty
patio. A recently whitewashed partition that bore
the imprints of fingers and entire hands divided this
basement into two compartments. In the first were
packed a heap of dustladen objects; the other, the
inner one, seemed to have been varnished black; a
window gave it light; nearby rose a narrow, slippery
stairway that disappeared into the ceiling. In the
middle of this second compartment a bearded fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dark and thin, was mounted beside a large
press, placing the paper, which there appeared as
white as snow, over the bed of the machine; another
man was receiving it. In a corner the oil motor that
supplied the power to the press was toiling painfully
on.</p>

<p>Manuel and Roberto climbed the stairway to a
long, narrow room which received light through two
windows that looked into the patio.</p>

<p>Against the wall of the room, and in the middle
as well, stood the printer’s cases, over which hung
several electric lights wrapped in newspaper cones
that served as shades.</p>

<p>Three men and a boy were at work before the
cases; one of the men, a lame fellow in a long blue
smock, a derby, with a sour face and spectacles on
his nose, was pacing up and down the room.</p>

<p>Roberto greeted the lame fellow and handed him
Sandoval’s letter. The man took the letter and
growled ill-naturedly:</p>

<p>“I don’t know why they come to me with matters
of this kind. Damn it all!...”</p>

<p>“This is the youngster who is to learn the trade,”
interrupted Roberto, coldly.</p>

<p>“Learn hell ...” and the cripple spat out ten
or a dozen curses and a string of blasphemies.</p>

<p>“Are you in bad humor today?”</p>

<p>“I’m as I darn please.... This cursed daily
grind.... It drives me to desperation.... Understand?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I do,” replied Roberto, adding, in a
stage “aside” such as is heard by the entire auditorium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“What patience one requires with this animal!”</p>

<p>“This is certainly a joke,” continued the cripple,
unheedful of the “aside.” “Suppose the kid does
want to learn the trade. What’s that got to do with
me? And suppose he has nothing to eat? How
does that concern me? Let him go to the deuce out
of here ... and good riddance.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to teach him or not, Señor Sánchez?
I’m a busy man and have no time to waste.”</p>

<p>“Ah! No time to waste! Then clear out, my
fine fellow. I don’t need you here at all. Let
the kid remain. You’re in the way here.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. You stay here,” said Roberto to Manuel.
“They’ll tell you what you have to do.”</p>

<p>Manuel stood perplexed; he saw his friend disappear,
looked around him in every direction, and
seeing that nobody paid any attention to him, he
walked over to the stairway and descended two
steps.</p>

<p>“Eh! Where are you going?” shouted the lame
man after him. “Do you want to learn the trade
or not? What do you call this?”</p>

<p>Manuel was more confused than ever.</p>

<p>“Hey, you, Yaco,” shouted the cripple, turning
to one of the men at the cases. “Teach this kid
the case.”</p>

<p>The man he had called,—a puny fellow, very
swarthy, with a black beard,—was working away
with astonishing rapidity. He cast an indifferent
glance in Manuel’s direction and resumed his work.</p>

<p>The youngster stood there motionless. Seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
him thus, the other typesetter, a blond young fellow
with a sickly look, turned to his bearded companion
jestingly and said to him in a queer sing-song:</p>

<p>“Ah, Yaco! Why don’t you teach the boy the
position of the letters?”</p>

<p>“Teach him yourself,” retorted he whom they
called Yaco.</p>

<p>“Ah, Yaco, I see that the law of Moses makes
you people very selfish, Yaco. You don’t want to
waste any time, do you, Yaco?”</p>

<p>The bearded compositor glared at his companion
with a sinister look; the blond fellow burst into
laughter and then showed Manuel where the various
letters of the alphabet were to be found; then he
brought over a column of used type which he had
drawn quickly from an iron form, and said:</p>

<p>“Now you’re to distribute every letter back into
its proper box.”</p>

<p>Manuel began the task at an exceedingly slow
pace.</p>

<p>The blond compositor wore a long blue smock
and a derby perched on one side of his head.
Bent over the case, his eyes very close to his copy,
with his composing-stick in his left hand, he set up
one line after the other with astonishing speed;
his right hand leaped dizzyingly from box to
box.</p>

<p>Often he would pause to light a cigarette, look
at his bearded companion and in a very jovial tone
ask him a question,—either a very silly one or such
as admits of no possible reply,—to which the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
man answered only with a sinister glance from his
black eyes.</p>

<p>It struck twelve; everybody ceased working and
went out. Manuel was left alone in the shop. At
first he had harbored the hope that he would be
given something to eat; then he came to the realization
that nobody had given himself any concern as
to his food. He reconnoitred the place; nothing
in the premises, unfortunately, was edible; he wondered
whether, if he were to remove the ink from
the surface of the rollers, they would be palatable,
but he arrived at no decision.</p>

<p>Yaco returned at two; shortly after came the
blond young man, whose name was Jesús, and the
work was resumed. Manuel continued distributing
the type, and Jesús and Yaco, setting.</p>

<p>The cripple corrected galleys, inked them, drew
proof by placing paper on them and striking it with
a mallet, after which, with a pair of tweezers, he
would extract certain letters and replace them with
others.</p>

<p>At midafternoon Jesús quit setting type and
changed work. He took the galleys, which were
tied around with twine, loosened them, shaped them
into columns, placed them in an iron chase and
locked them with quoins.</p>

<p>The form was carried off by one of the pressmen
of the basement who returned with it inside of an
hour. Jesús replaced some of the columns with
others and the form was again removed. Shortly
afterward the same operation was repeated.</p>

<p>After working away until seven the men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
about to leave, when Manuel went over to Jesús and
asked:</p>

<p>“Won’t the boss give me anything to eat?”</p>

<p>“Ho! The idea!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any money; I didn’t even have any
breakfast.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t? See here. Come along with me.”</p>

<p>They left the printing-shop together and entered
a hovel on the Calle de Silva, where Jesús ate. The
blond young man engaged in conversation with the
proprietor and then came over to Manuel, saying:</p>

<p>“You’ll get your meals here on tick. I’ve told
him I’ll be responsible for you. Now see to it that
you don’t be up to any knavish tricks.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“Very good. Let’s go inside. It’s my treat today.”</p>

<p>They walked into the dining-room of the shack
and sat down before a table.</p>

<p>The waiter brought them a platter of bread,
stew and wine. As they ate, Jesús recounted in
humorous fashion a number of anecdotes relating
to the proprietor of the printing-shop, to the journalists,
and, above all, to Yaco, the fellow with the
beard, who was a Jew, a very good fellow, but as
stingy and sordid as they come.</p>

<p>Jesús would banter him and provoke him just for
the sake of listening to his rejoinders.</p>

<p>When they had finished their supper, Jesús asked
Manuel:</p>

<p>“Have you a place to sleep?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“There must be some corner in the printing-shop.”</p>

<p>They returned to the shop and the compositor
asked the cripple to let Manuel sleep in some corner.</p>

<p>“Damn it all!” exclaimed the cripple, “this is
going to become a regular Mountain Shelter. Such
a band of ragamuffins! The lame fellow may be an
ill-humoured cuss but everybody comes here just the
same. You bet.”</p>

<p>Grumbling, as was his wont, the cripple opened
a dingy sty that was reached by ascending several
stairways; it was cluttered with engravings wrapped
in sheets. He pointed to a corner where some
excelsior and a few old cloaks were heaped.</p>

<p>Manuel slept like a prince in this hole.</p>

<p>On the next day the owner sent him down to the
basement.</p>

<p>“Just watch what this fellow is doing, and you do
the same,” he instructed, pointing to the thin,
bearded man who stood on the platform of the
press.</p>

<p>The man was taking a sheet of paper from a pile
and placing it upon the feed board; at once the
grippers reached forward and seized the sheet with
the certainty of fingers; at a movement of the wheel
the machine would swallow the paper and within
a moment the sheet would issue, printed on one side,
and some small sticks, like the ribs of a fan, would
deposit it upon the fly table. Manuel very
soon acquired the necessary skill.</p>

<p>The proprietor arranged that Manuel should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
work mornings at the cases, and afternoons and part
of the night at the press, paying him for this a daily
wage of six reales. During the afternoons it was
fairly possible to stand the toil in the cellar; at
night it was beyond endurance. Between the gasoline
motor and the oil lamps the air was asphyxiating.</p>

<p>After a week in the place, Manuel had become
intimate with Jesús and Yaco.</p>

<p>Jesús advised Manuel to apply himself to the
cases and learn as soon as possible how to set type.</p>

<p>“At least you’ll be sure of making a living.”</p>

<p>“But it’s very hard,” said Manuel.</p>

<p>“Bah, man. Once you get used to it, it’s far
easier than rolling off a log.”</p>

<p>Manuel worked away at the cases whenever he
could, trying his best to acquire speed; some nights
he actually set up lines, and how proud it made him
afterward to see them in print!</p>

<p>Jesús amused himself by teasing the Jew, mimicking
his manner of speech. They had both been living
for some months in the same tenement, Yaco
(his real name was Jacob) with his family and
Jesús with his two sisters.</p>

<p>Jesús delighted to drive Jacob out of all patience
and hear him utter picturesque maledictions in his
soft, mellifluous language with its long-drawn s’s.</p>

<p>According to Jesús, at Jacob’s home his wife, his
father-in-law and he himself spoke the weirdest jargon
imaginable,—a mixture of Arabic and archaic
Spanish that sounded exceedingly rare.</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Yaco,” Jesús would ask, imitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the Jew’s pronunciation, “when you brought
your wife, Mesoda, that canary? And she asked
you: ‘Ah, Yaco, what sort of bird is this with yellow
wings?’ And you answered her: ‘Ah, Mesoda!
This bird is a canary and I have brought it for
you.’”</p>

<p>Jacob, seeing everybody laugh at him, would cast
a terrible glance at Jesús and cry out:</p>

<p>“Wretch that you are! May you be struck by a
dart that blots out your name from the book of the
living!”</p>

<p>“And when Mesoda said to you,” continued
Jesús, “‘Stay here, Yaco, stay with me. Ah, Yaco,
how ill I am! I have a dove in my heart, a hammer
on each breast and a fish on my neck. Call my
<i>baba</i>; have her bring me a twig of <i>letuario</i>, Yaco!’”</p>

<p>These domestic intimacies, thus treated in jest,
exasperated Jacob; hearing them, he lost his temper
completely and his imprecations outdistanced those
of Camilla.</p>

<p>“You have no respect for the family, you dog,”
he would conclude.</p>

<p>“The family!” Jesús would retort. “The first
thing a fellow should do is forget it. Parents,
brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts and cousins,—what
are they all but a botheration? The first thing
a man should learn is to disobey his parents and
have no belief in God.”</p>

<p>“Silence, you infidel, silence! May your sides fill
up with watery vapor and your heart be consumed
with fire. May the black broom sweep you off if
you continue such blasphemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesús would greet these curses with laughter, and
after having allowed Jacob to vent his wrath, would
add:</p>

<p>“A couple of thousand years ago, this animal
who’s nothing but a printer today would have been
a prophet, and would be in the Bible together with
Matthew, Zabulon and all that small fry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” snarled Jacob.</p>

<p>When the discussion was over, Jesús would say
to him:</p>

<p>“You know very well, Yaco, that a chasm yawns
between your ideas and mine; but despite all that, if
you’ll accept the invitation of a Christian, I invite
you to a glass.”</p>

<p>Jacob would nod acceptance.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Names of the “Toads”—The Director of <i>Los Debates</i>
and His Editorial Staff</p>

</div>

<p>Sánchez Gómez the printer, who was also
known by the nickname Plancheta, was a
wealthy man, though he toiled away daily like
a common workman. He was a person of diabolically
uneven temper, of corrosive joviality and, at
bottom, good-hearted.</p>

<p>He was the most picturesque and versatile printer
in Madrid, and his business was likewise the most
complicated and interesting.</p>

<p>One thing alone was sufficient to give the measure
of the man: with a single press, run by a gasoline
engine of the old type, he published nine newspapers,
the titles of which no one could call insignificant.</p>

<p><i>Los Debates</i> (Debates); <i>El Porvenir</i> (The
Future); <i>La Nación</i> (The Nation); <i>La Tarde</i>
(Afternoon); <i>El Radical</i> (The Radical); <i>La
Mañana</i> (Morning); <i>El Mundo</i> (The World); <i>El
Tiempo</i> (The Times); and <i>La Prensa</i> (The Press);
all these important dailies were born in the basement
of the printery. To any ordinary man this
would appear impossible; for Sánchez Gómez, that
Proteus of Typography, the word impossible existed
only in the dictionary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Each of these important newspapers had a column
of its own; all the rest, news, literary articles, advertisements,
feuilletons, announcements, was common
to them all.</p>

<p>Sánchez Gómez, in his newspapers, paired individualism
and collectivism. Each of his organs enjoyed
absolute autonomy and independence, and yet, each
resembled the other as closely as two drops of
water. The lame fellow thus realized in his publications
unity and variety.</p>

<p><i>El Radical</i>, for example, a rabidly Republican
paper, devoted its first column to attacking the
Government and the priesthood; but its news items
were the same as those of <i>El Mundo</i>, an impenitently
conservative daily which employed its first column in
defense of the church, that Holy Ark of our traditions;
the Monarchy, that glorious institution,
symbol of our Fatherland; the Army, most powerful
bulwark of our nationality; the Constitution, that
compendium of our public liberties....</p>

<p>Of all the newspapers printed there, <i>Los Debates</i>
alone constituted a profitable venture for its proprietor,
Don Pedro Sampayo y Sánchez del Pelgar.
<i>Los Debates</i>—using the figures of speech employed
in the daily—was a terrible battering-ram against
the purse of the politicians, an inexpugnable fortress
for the needs of the creditors.</p>

<p>Blackmail, in the hands of the newspaper director,
was converted into a terrible weapon; neither the
ancient catapult nor the modern cannon could be
compared with it.</p>

<p>The newspaper owned by Don Pedro Sampayo y<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Sánchez del Pelgar had three columns of its own.</p>

<p>These columns were written by a huge, thick-set
Galician of most uncouth appearance, named
González Parla, who wielded a pen that went
straight to the point, and by a certain Señor
Fresneda, as thin as a rail, exceedingly delicate, well
dressed and always starving.</p>

<p>Langairiños, the Superman, was on the staff of
<i>Los Debates</i>, but only as an aliquot part, since his
works of genius were printed in the nine toads that
were born daily in Sánchez Gómez’s printery.</p>

<p>It is high time that we introduced Langairiños.
The newspaper-men called him Superman in jest,—Super
for short—, because he was forever prating
about the coming of Nietzsche’s superman; they did
not realize that, jest or no jest, they but did him
justice.</p>

<p>He was the highest, the loftiest of the editorial
staff; sometimes he signed himself Máximo, at
others, Mínimo; but his name,—his real name, that
which he immortalized daily, and increasingly every
day, in <i>Los Debates</i>, or in <i>El Tiempo</i>, <i>El Mundo</i> or
<i>El Radical</i>, was Ernesto Langairiños.</p>

<p>Langairiños! A sweet, sonorous name, somewhat
like a cool zephyr in a summer twilight.
Langairiños! A dream.</p>

<p>The great Langairiños was between thirty and
forty; a pronounced abdomen, aquiline nose and a
strong, thick black beard.</p>

<p>One of the imbeciles among his enemies, seeing
him so vertebrate and cerebral,—one of those vipers
who try to sink their fangs into the armour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
great personalities,—asseverated that Langairiños’s
appearance was grotesque. A false statement
whichever way you look at it, for, despite the fact
that his attire did not respond to the requirements
of the most foppish dandyism; despite the fact that
his trousers were always baggy and frayed, and his
sack-coats studded with constellations of stains; despite
all this, his natural elegance, his air of superiority
and distinction erased these minor imperfections,
even as the waves of the sea wipe out tracks
upon the sand of the beach.</p>

<p>Langairiños practised criticism, and a cruel
criticism it was. His articles appeared simultaneously
in nine newspapers. His impressionistic
manner scorned such banal phrases as “La Señorita
Pérez rose to great heights,” “the characters of the
work are well sustained,” and others of the same
class.</p>

<p>In two apothegms the Superman concentrated
all his ideas as to the world that surrounded him.
They were two terrible sentences, in a bitter, lacerating
style. If any one asserted that such and such
a politician or journalist had influence, money or
ability, he would reply: “Yes, yes, I know whom
you mean.” And if another announced that a certain
novelist or dramatist was at work upon a new
book or piece, or had just finished one, he would
answer: “Very good; very good. Through the
other door.”</p>

<p>Langairiños’s superior type of mind did not permit
him to suppose that any man other than himself
could be any better than another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>His masterpiece was an article entitled “They’re
All Ragamuffins.” It was a conversation between
a master of journalism—himself—and a cub reporter.</p>

<p>This avalanche of Attic salt concluded with the
following gem of humour:</p>

<p><i>The Cub Reporter</i>: One must have principles.</p>

<p><i>The Master</i>: At table.</p>

<p><i>The Cub Reporter</i>: The country should be told
things straight from the shoulder.</p>

<p><i>The Master</i>: It would get indigestion. Remember
the boarding-house peas.</p>

<p>That was the Superman’s regular style, a terrible,
Shakesperian manner.</p>

<p>As a result of the cerebral exhaustion produced
by these intellectual labours, the Super was troubled
with neurasthenia, and as a cure for his ailment he
took glycerophosphate of lime with his meals and
did gymnastics.</p>

<p>Manuel recalled having often heard in Doña
Casiana’s boarding-house a sonorous voice bravely
and untiringly counting the number of leg and
arm flexions. Twenty-five ... twenty-six ...
twenty-seven, until a hundred or more was reached.
That Bayard of Callisthenics was none other than
Langairiños.</p>

<p>The other two editors could not be likened unto
Langairiños. González Parla, with that porter’s
face of his, looked like a barbarian. He was
brutally frank; he called a spade a spade, politicians
leeches and the newspapers printed by Sánchez
Gómez, <i>the toads</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The other editor, Fresneda, outrivalled in finesse
the most tactful and effeminate man that could
be found in Madrid. He experienced a veritable
delight in calling everybody Señor. Fresneda managed
only by a miracle to keep alive. He spent
his whole life starving, yet this roused no wrath in
his soul.</p>

<p>In order to get Sampayo, proprietor of <i>Los
Debates</i>, to pay them a few pesetas, González
Parla and Fresneda were compelled to resort to all
manner of expedients. The hope harbored by the
pair, which was a credential obtained through the
proprietary director, was never realized.</p>

<p>Manuel had heard so much talk about Sampayo
that he was curious to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p>He was a tall, erect gentleman, of noble appearance,
about sixty-odd years old; various times he
had filled the office of Governor, thanks to his wife,
a fine-looking female who in her halcyon days had
been able to wheedle anything out of a Minister.
Wherever this couple had passed through in the
course of the husband’s official duties, not a nail was
left in the wall.</p>

<p>Sampayo’s wife was very friendly with certain
wealthy gentlemen, but in just reciprocity, so super-womanly
and tolerant she was, she always picked out
good-looking, obliging maids, so that her husband
should have no cause for complaint.</p>

<p>And what a human spectacle their home
presented! At times, when Señora de Sampayo returned
somewhat weary after one of her little adventures,
she would find her noble-looking husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
dining hand in hand with the maid, if not embracing
her tenderly.</p>

<p>The couple squandered their entire income; but
Sampayo was so skilful in the art of making creditors
and then fighting them off, that they always managed
to raise a few coins.</p>

<p>Once when González Parla, who was in an ugly
mood, and Fresneda, as amiable as ever, called on
Sampayo, addressing him every other moment as
the Director Señor Sampayo, and explained to him
the dire straits in which they found themselves, the
director gave Fresneda a letter to a South American
general, asking for some money. Sampayo imposed
upon his editor the condition that all over ten duros
should go to the newspaper cash-box.</p>

<p>When the two editors reached the street,
González Parla asked his companion for the letter,
and the spectral journalist handed it to him.</p>

<p>“I’ll go to see this knave of a general,” promised
González Parla, “and I’ll get the money from him.
Then we’ll divide it. Half for you and the other
half for me.”</p>

<p>The skinny editor accompanied the corpulent to
the general’s house.</p>

<p>The general, a little Mexican, dressed like a
macaw, read the director’s letter, looked at the
journalist, readjusted his spectacles and eyed him
from top to bottom, asking:</p>

<p>“Are you <i>Señó</i> Fresneda?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course. I’m the man.”</p>

<p>“But you’re consumptive, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I? No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what they tell me in this letter, understand?...
That you have seven children and
that from your looks I can understand that you’re in
the final stage of consumption, see?”</p>

<p>González Parla was non-plussed. He confessed
that it was true he did not have consumption; but
he had had a consumptive father, and since his
father had suffered from tuberculosis, the doctors
had told him that he, too, would contract it,—that,
indeed, he was already in the early stages, so that if
he were as yet not really consumptive, it was almost
the same as if he were.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand all this, see?” said the
general, after listening to so defective an explanation.
“I do gather, though, that this is a hoax.
How can a fellow be so fat and yet be sick, hey?
But, anyway,” and he handed out a bill folded between
his fingers, “take this and be off with you, and
don’t be such a faker.”</p>

<p>“This corpulency is misleading,” replied González
Parla humbly, accepting the bill. “It’s due to all
the potatoes I eat.” And he disappeared in shame,
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>The note was for a hundred pesetas, and the
skinny editor divided it with the corpulent, to the
great indignation of Sampayo. The director vowed
that he would not pay them a céntimo for months
and months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Once, Fresneda reduced to the final gasps of
hunger, uttered the sole energetic sentence of his
entire career.</p>

<p>“I’ll write you a recommendation to the
Ministry,” the director had said to him, in answer to
a request for money.</p>

<p>“To die of hunger, Señor de Sampayo,” Fresneda
had replied, with a flash of independence not
devoid of his proverbial finesse, “one does not require
letters of recommendation.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Santa Casilda Hostelry—Jacob’s History—La Fea and
La Sinforosa—The Motherless Child—A not Very
Merry Christmas</p>

</div>

<p>By the time spring came around Manuel was
setting type with ease. Somewhat later, the
third compositor left, and Jesús advised the
boss to let Manuel fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>“But he doesn’t know anything,” replied the
owner.</p>

<p>“What need he know? Pay him by the line.”</p>

<p>“No. I’ll raise his daily wage.”</p>

<p>“How much are you going to give him?”</p>

<p>“Eight reales.”</p>

<p>“That’s too little. The other fellow got twelve.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll give him nine. But let him
not come here to sleep.”</p>

<p>Manuel’s new position freed him from the duty
of sweeping the shop. He abandoned the sty in
which he had been sleeping. Jesús took him to the
Santa Casilda hostelry, where he himself stayed; it
was a huge, one-story structure with three very large
patios, situated on the Ronda de Toledo. Manuel
would have preferred not to return to this section,
which was linked in his memory to so many unpleasant
recollections; but his friendship with Jesús<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
won him over. He got, at the hostelry, for a fortnightly
rent of eight reales, a tiny room with a bed,
a broken reed chair and a mat hanging from the ceiling
and serving as the door. When the wind blew
from the direction of the fields of San Isidro, the
rooms and the corridors of the Santa Casilda
hostelry were filled with smoke. The patios of the
place were more or less like those at Uncle Rilo’s
house, with identical galleries and numbered doors.</p>

<p>From the window of Manuel’s den could be seen
three red, round-paunched tanks of the gashouse,
with their lofty iron girders that ended in pulleys
at the top; round about was the Rastro; to one side,
dumping-places blackened with coal and slag;
farther on stretched the arid landscape, the yellow
slopes of which climbed into the horizon. Directly
before him rose the Los Ángeles hill with the hermitage
on its crest.</p>

<p>In the very next room to that which Manuel occupied
were a carpenter, his wife and a child. The
couple would get drunk and beat the child unmercifully.</p>

<p>Many a time Manuel was on the point of bursting
into the room, for it seemed to him that those beasts
were torturing the little girl.</p>

<p>One morning, encountering the carpenter’s wife,
he said to her:</p>

<p>“Why do you beat that poor little girl so?”</p>

<p>“Is it any of your business?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t she my daughter? I can do what I please
with her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what your mother should have done with
you,” retorted Manuel. “Beat the life out of you
for a witch.”</p>

<p>The woman grumbled something or other and
Manuel went off to the printing-shop.</p>

<p>That night the carpenter stopped Manuel.</p>

<p>“What was it you said to my wife, eh?”</p>

<p>“I told her that she oughtn’t to beat her
daughter.”</p>

<p>“And who told you to mix into this business?”</p>

<p>The carpenter was a ferocious-looking fellow with
a wide, bulging space between his eyebrows, and a
bull neck. His forehead was crossed by a swollen
vein. Manuel made no reply.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him the carpenter and his wife
soon moved from the place.</p>

<p>In the holes of the same corridor there lived also
two aged gipsies together with their families, both
exceedingly noisy and thievish; a blind maiden who
sang gipsy songs in the streets, wiggling with epileptic
convulsions, and who was accompanied by another
lass with whom she was for ever fighting, and
two very cheap, very slovenly sisters, with painted
cheeks and loud voices,—a pair of lying, quarrelsome
strumpets, but as happy as goats.</p>

<p>Jesús’s room was near Manuel’s, and this life in
common both at the printing-shop and at the house
tightened the bonds of their friendship.</p>

<p>Jesús was an excellent youth, but he got drunk
with lamentable frequency. He had two maiden
sisters, one a pretty chit with green cat’s eyes and an
impudent face, called La Sinforosa, and the other a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
sickly creature, all twisted and scrofulous, whom
everybody heartlessly called La Fea, ugly.</p>

<p>After they had been living thus for two months or
so at the hostelry, Jesús, in his peculiar, ironic tone,
remarked one day to Manuel on the way to the
shop:</p>

<p>“Did you hear? My sister is pregnant.”</p>

<p>“That so?”</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“Which of the two?”</p>

<p>“La Fea. I wonder who the hero could have
been. He deserves a cross of valour.”</p>

<p>The compositor continued to prattle about the
misfortune, jesting upon it indifferently.</p>

<p>This did not appear very just to Manuel; after
all, she was the man’s sister. But Jesús launched
forth with his invectives against the family, declaring
that a fellow need not concern himself about his
brothers and sisters, his parents, or anybody.</p>

<p>“A fine theory for egotists,” answered Manuel.</p>

<p>“Why, the family is nothing but egotism that
favours a few as against humanity,” agreed Jesús.</p>

<p>“Much you care about humanity. As little as for
your family,” retorted Manuel.</p>

<p>This topic was the theme of a number of other
discussions, in the heat of which they spoke some
bitter, mortifying words to each other.</p>

<p>Manuel was not much concerned about the
theoretical problem. What did fill him with indignation,
however, was to see that Jesús and La Sinforosa
took no pity upon their sister, sending her on
errands and making her sweep the place when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
poor rachitic creature couldn’t stir because of her
huge abdomen, which threatened to become monstrous.
As a result of these altercations there were
days on which Manuel exchanged scarcely two
words with Jesús, preferring to chat with Jacob and
ask him questions about his native land.</p>

<p>Jacob, despite the fact that he was always lamenting
the evil days he had suffered in his country, was
fond of speaking about it.</p>

<p>He came from Fez and was wildly enthusiastic
over that city.</p>

<p>He depicted it as a paradise flourishing with
gardens, palm-trees, lemon and orange trees, and beribboned
with crystalline streamlets. In Fez, in the
Jewish quarter Jacob had passed his childhood, until
he entered the service of a wealthy merchant who
did business in Rabat, Mogador and Saffi.</p>

<p>With his lively imagination and his exaggerated
speech, which was so picturesque and thronged with
imagery, Jacob communicated an impression of
reality whenever he spoke of his country.</p>

<p>He pictured the procession of the caravans composed
of camels, asses and dromedaries. These last
he described with their long necks and their small
heads, swaying like those of serpents, with their
dull eyes directed toward the sky. As one listened
to him at the height of his evocations one imagined
that one was crossing those white sands in the blinding
sun. He described, too, the markets that were
set up at the intersection of several roads and characterized
the folk who came to them: the Moors of
the nearby Kabyles, with their guns; the serpent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
charmers; the sorcerers; the tellers of tales from the
Thousand And One Nights, the medicine men who
draw worms from human ears.</p>

<p>And as the caravans departed, each proceeding
on its different way, the men mounted on their
horses and mules, Jacob would imitate the cawing of
the crows that swooped down in flocks upon the
market place and covered it with a black cloak.</p>

<p>He pictured the effect of beholding thirty or forty
Berbers on horseback, with their flowing locks,
armed with long muskets. As they passed a Jew
they would spit upon the ground. He told of the
uncertain life there; on the roads, earless, armless
folk, victims of justice, begging alms in the name of
Muley Edris; during the winter, the dangerous
crossing of the rivers, the nights at the gates of the
villages, while the <i>cus-cus</i> was being prepared, playing
the <i>guembrí</i> and singing sad, drowsy airs.</p>

<p>One Sabbath Jacob invited Manuel to eat with
him at his house.</p>

<p>The Jew lived in the Pozas section, in a ramshackle
house on a lane near the Paseo de Areneros.</p>

<p>The tiny structure looked strange, somewhat
Oriental. One or two low pine tables; small mats
instead of chairs, and, hanging from the walls,
coloured cloths and two small three-stringed guitars.</p>

<p>Manuel was introduced to Jacob’s father, a long-haired
old fellow who walked about the house in a
dark tunic and a cap, to his wife, Mesoda, and to a
black-eyed child called Aisa.</p>

<p>They all sat down to table; the old man solemnly
pronounced a number of words in an involved language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
which Manuel took for some Hebrew
prayer, and then they began to eat.</p>

<p>The meal had a taste of strong aromatic herbs
and to Manuel it seemed that he was chewing
flowers.</p>

<p>At table the old man, employing that extravagant
Castilian in which the entire family spoke, recounted
to Manuel the events of the African war. In his
version Prim, or, as he referred to him, Señor Juan
Prim, assumed epic proportions. Jacob must
have respected the old man very deeply, for he
allowed him to speak on and on about Prim and
about the Almighty. Mesoda, who was very
timid, only smiled, and blushed upon the slightest
provocation.</p>

<p>After the meal Jacob took down from the wall one
of the small three-stringed guitars and sang several
Arabian songs, accompanying himself on the primitive
instrument.</p>

<p>Manuel bid adieu to Jacob’s family and promised
to visit them from time to time.</p>

<p class="tb">One autumn night, as Manuel was returning from
work after a day during which Jesús had not put in
an appearance at the shop, he entered the hostelry to
find in the corridor leading to his room a knot of
women gossiping about Jesús and his sisters.</p>

<p>La Fea had given birth; the doctor from the
Emergency Hospital was in her room together
with Señora Salomona, a kindly woman who made
her living as a nurse.</p>

<p>“But what has Jesús done?” asked Manuel, hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the insults heaped upon the typesetter by the
angry women.</p>

<p>“What has he done?” replied one of them.
“Nothing at all, only it’s come out that he’s been
living with La Sinfo, who’s the blackest of black
sheep. Jesús and she had taken to drink and that
big fox of a Sinfo has been taking La Fea’s pay
from her.”</p>

<p>“That can’t be true,” said Manuel.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Well, Jesús himself was the one to
tell it.”</p>

<p>“H’m. The other one isn’t any too decent herself
when it comes to that,” interpolated one of the
women.</p>

<p>“She’s as decent as the best of them,” retorted
the spokeswoman. “She told everything to the
doctor from the Emergency Hospital. One night
when she hadn’t had a bite in her mouth, because
Jesús and La Sinfo had taken every céntimo from
her, La Fea went and drank a drop of brandy to
quiet her hunger; then she had another; she was so
weak that she got drunk right away. In came La
Sinfo and Jesús, both stewed to the gills, and the
shameless fox, seeing La Fea in bed, said to her, she
says: ‘Out with you. We need the bed ourselves
for ...’ and here she made an indecent gesture.
You know what I mean. And she goes and
shows her sister the door. La Fea, who was too
tipsy to know what was going on, went into the
street, and an officer, seeing how drunk she was, took
her to the station and shoved her into a dark cell,
where some tramp....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who must have been drunk himself,” interjected
a mason, who had paused to hear the story.</p>

<p>“So there you are ...” concluded the gossip.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that if there had been light in the cell
nothing would have happened, for the moment the
guy caught sight of that face he would have turned
sober with fright,” added the mason, continuing
on his way.</p>

<p>Manuel left the gabbling women and stopped in
the doorway of Jesús’s room. It was a desolating
spectacle. The typesetter’s sister, pale, with closed
eyes, thrown across the floor on a few mats and covered
with burlap, looked like a corpse. The doctor
was bandaging her at that moment. Señora Salomona
was dressing the newborn. A pool of blood
stained the stone flooring.</p>

<p>Jesús, leaning against the wall in a corner, was
gazing impassibly at the doctor and his sister out of
glittering eyes.</p>

<p>The physician requested the neighbours to fetch a
quilt and a few sheets; when these articles had been
brought they placed the quilt upon the mat and laid
La Fea carefully into the improvised bed. The
poor twisted creature looked like a skeleton; her
breasts were as flat as a man’s, and though she had
no strength to move, when they brought the child to
her side she changed position and tried to suckle it.</p>

<p>Gazing upon this scene, Manuel glared angrily at
Jesús.</p>

<p>He could have beaten the typesetter with
pleasure for having permitted his sister to come to
this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The physician, after having finished his task,
took Jesús over to the end of the gallery and engaged
in private conversation with him. Jesús was
willing to do exactly as he was told; he would give
every céntimo of his pay to La Fea, he promised.</p>

<p>Then, when the physician had left, Jesús fell
into the hands of the women, who made a rag of
him.</p>

<p>He denied nothing. Quite the contrary.</p>

<p>“During her pregnancy,” he confessed, “she slept
on the floor, on the mat.”</p>

<p>The chorus of women received the compositor’s
words with indignation. He shrugged his shoulders
stupidly.</p>

<p>“Just imagine the poor creature sleeping on the
mat while La Sinfo and Jesús lay in bed!” exclaimed
one.</p>

<p>And higher and higher rose the indignation
against La Sinfo, that shameless street-walker,
whom they vowed to give an unmerciful drubbing.
Señora Salomona had to interrupt their chatter, for
it kept the woman in childbed awake.</p>

<p>La Sinfo must have suspected something, for she
did not show up at the hostelry. Jesús, frowning
glumly, his cheeks aflame and his eyes aglitter, went
on the following days from house to shop without
a word. Manuel had a notion that the young man
was in love with his sister.</p>

<p>During the period of her confinement the neighbours
took affectionate care of La Fea. They demanded
every céntimo of Jesús’s pay, and he surrendered
it without any resistance whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The newborn child, emaciated and hydrocephalic,
died within a week.</p>

<p>La Sinforosa never appeared there again. According
to gossip she had gone into the <em>profession</em>.</p>

<p class="tb">The day before Christmas, toward evening, three
gentleman dressed in black came to the place. One
was a diminutive old fellow with white moustaches
and merry eyes; the second was a stiff gentleman
with a greying beard and gold-rimmed spectacles;
the other appeared to be a secretary or a clerk, and
was short, with black moustaches, burdened with
documents and tapping his heels as he walked. It
was said that they came from La Conferencia de
San Vicente de Paul; they visited Jesús’ sister and
other persons who lived in the nooks and crannies
of the house.</p>

<p>Behind these gentlemen attired in black went
Manuel and Jesús, who only slept at the hostelry
and did not know the neighbourhood, so that they
walked about their own place as strangers.</p>

<p>“Hypocrites!” cried the mason at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>“But, man. Hush!” exclaimed Manuel. “They
might hear you.”</p>

<p>“And suppose they do?” retorted the neighbour.
“Let them! They’re nothing but a gang of
hypocrites. Who asks them to come here and pretend
to be charitable souls? They come here to
show off, to put on airs,—that’s what they come
for. The mountebanks, the Jesuits! What in hell
do they want to find out? That we live badly?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
That we’ve turned to swine? That we don’t attend
to our children? That we get drunk? Very
well. Let them give us their money and we’ll live
better. But don’t let them come here with their
certificates and their advice.”</p>

<p>The three visitors went into a hole a couple of
metres square. On the floor, upon a litter of rags
and straw, lay a dropsical woman with a swollen,
silly face.</p>

<p>A young woman was seated in a chair, sewing by
lamplight.</p>

<p>From the corridor Manuel could hear the conversation
that was taking place inside.</p>

<p>The little old man with the white moustaches was
asking in his merry voice what ailed the woman,
and a neighbour who lived in an adjoining room was
relating an endless tale of wretchedness and squalor.</p>

<p>The dropsical woman bore her woes with extraordinary
resignation.</p>

<p>Misfortune battened upon her and she sank lower
and lower until she reached this doleful position.
She could not find a friendly hand, and her sole benefactors
had been a butcher and his wife, former
servants of hers in better days whom she had
helped to set up in business. The butcher’s
wife, who was also a moneylender, used to purchase
cloaks and Manila handkerchiefs in the Rastro, and
when there was anything to mend or to put into order
she would bring it to the invalid’s daughter for
repair.</p>

<p>This service the former servant rewarded by
giving the daughter of her mistress a heap of bones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and, at times, when she was particularly pleased with
a piece of work, by presenting her with the remainders
of a meal.</p>

<p>“A hell of a generous lady, the butcher’s wife!”
commented the mason, who had listened to the
neighbour’s story.</p>

<p>“Even the common folk,” replied Jesús jestingly,
recalling a zarzuela refrain, “has its tender heart.”</p>

<p>The gentlemen from La Conferencia de Paul,
after having heard so moving an account, gave three
food tickets to the dropsical woman and left the
room.</p>

<p>“Now the woman’s happy,” muttered Jesús, ironically.
“She was going to die tomorrow and now
she can last until the day after. What more does
she want?”</p>

<p>“I should say,” chimed the mason.</p>

<p>The secretary,—the fellow burdened with so
many documents, recalled a case similar to that of
the dropsical woman, and he declared that it was
most curious and extremely interesting.</p>

<p>As the three gentlemen were turning down one
corridor to go into another, an old lady approached
them, addressing them as “Your grace,” and asking
them to accompany her. She led the way with a
candle to a garret, or, more exactly speaking, a dark
nook beneath a staircase. On a heap of rags,
wrapped in a frayed cloak, lay an emaciated, filthy
little girl, her face dark and wan, her eyes black, shy
and glittering. At her side slept a little boy of
two or three.</p>

<p>“I wish Your grace would place this little girl in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
an asylum,” said the old woman. “She’s an
orphan; her mother, who—begging your pardon—did
not lead a very good life, died here. She’s
planted herself in this hole and nobody can make her
stir. She steals eggs, bread, whatever she can lay
her hands upon, sometimes in one house, sometimes
in another, so that she can feed the baby. I wish
you could see that she’s placed in an asylum.”</p>

<p>The little girl stared out of her large eyes,
frightened at sight of the three gentlemen, and
seized the infant by the hand.</p>

<p>“This little girl,” declared the secretary from behind
his bundle of documents, “has a genuinely
curious affection for her tiny brother, and I am not
sure that it would not be cruel to separate them.”</p>

<p>“An asylum would be better,” insisted the old
woman.</p>

<p>“We’ll see. We’ll see,” replied the old gentleman.
The trio took their departure.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Jesús of the girl.</p>

<p>“Me? Salvadora.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to come and live with me, together
with your little brother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the lass, without a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, let’s be going. Get up. La
Fea will be happy to have them,” said Jesús, as if to
give an explanation of his impulse. “Otherwise
they’ll separate this little girl from her brother, and
that would be an outrage.”</p>

<p>The lass took the babe in her arms and followed
Jesús. La Fea must have received the two forsaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
children with intense enthusiasm. Manuel was not
present, for a young man had stopped him in the
corridor.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me?” he asked directly in front
of Manuel.</p>

<p>“Of course, man.... You’re El Aristón.”</p>

<p>“That’s me.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here?”</p>

<p>“Over in El Corral.”</p>

<p>El Corral was one of the patios of the hostelry,
and opened upon that pestilential Rastro which extends
from La Ronda to the gashouse. El Aristón
was as full of necromania as ever. He spoke to
Manuel only of deaths, burials and funereal matters.</p>

<p>He told Manuel that on Sundays he visited burial
grounds; for he considered it a duty to fulfil that
merciful work which bids one to bury the dead.</p>

<p>During the course of the conversation the necromaniac
insinuated the notion that if the king were to
die they could make a wonderful interment; but despite
this, he imagined that the burial of the Pope
would be even more sumptuous.</p>

<p>The necromaniac and Manuel passed through
several corridors.</p>

<p>“Where are you taking me?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“If you want to come, you can see a corpse.”</p>

<p>“And what are you going to do with this corpse?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to watch over him and pray for him,”
replied El Aristón.</p>

<p>In a tiny room lighted by two candles stuck in the
necks of bottles, there was a dead man stretched out
on a mattress....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>From afar came the sound of tambourines and
songs; from time to time the shrill voice of some
drunken old hag would shout:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

that moment, nobody.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Roberto’s Christmas—Northern Folk.</p>

</div>

<p>At this same hour Roberto Hasting, wrapped
in his overcoat, was on his way to Bernardo
Santín’s home. The night was cold; hardly
a person was to be seen on the street; the tramcars
glided hurriedly over the rails with a gentle drone.</p>

<p>Roberto entered the house, climbed to the top
story and knocked. Esther opened the door and he
walked in.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bernardo?” asked Roberto.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t appeared all day,” answered the ex-teacher.</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Esther, huddled into a shawl, sat down before the
table. The room, formerly the photographer’s
gallery, was lighted by an oil lamp. Everything
bore witness to the direst poverty.</p>

<p>“Have they taken away the camera?” asked
Roberto.</p>

<p>“Yes. This morning. I have my money locked
in this chest. What would you advise me to do,
Roberto?”</p>

<p>Roberto strode up and down the room with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
eyes fixed upon the floor. All at once he drew up
before Esther.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to be perfectly frank with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Perfectly. Just as you’d speak to a good
friend.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. I believe that what you ought
to do is—. I don’t know whether the advice will
strike you as brutal....”</p>

<p>“Go on....”</p>

<p>“What I believe is that you ought to get a separation
from your husband.”</p>

<p>Esther was silent.</p>

<p>“You’ve fallen into the hands, not of a knave nor
of a beast, but of an unfortunate, a poor imbecile,
without talent, without energy, incapable alike of
living or of appreciating you.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do?”</p>

<p>“What? Return to your old life,—to your piano
and English lessons. Would the separation grieve
you?”</p>

<p>“No. Quite the contrary. Take my word for
it: I haven’t the slightest affection for Bernardo.
He fills me with pity and aversion. What’s more,
I never cared for him.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you marry him?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? Fate, the treacherous advice
of a friend, ignorance of his real character. It
was one of those things that are done without
knowing why. The very next day I was remorseful.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine. When I learned that Bernardo
was to be married, I thought to myself: ‘It must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
be some adventuress who wishes to legalize her
situation with a man.’ Then, when I got to know
you, I asked myself: ‘How could this woman have
been deceived by so insignificant a creature as Bernardo?
There’s no explanation. No money, no
talent, no industry. Whatever could have impelled
an educated woman, a woman of feeling, to marry
such a dolt?’ I have never been able to explain it
since. Could you possibly have divined an artist
in him,—or a man who, though poor, was willing to
work and struggle?”</p>

<p>“No. They put all that into my head. To understand
my decision you’d have to let me tell you
the story of my life, ever since I reached Madrid
with my mother. We lived modestly on a small
pension that a relation sent us from Paris. I had
completed my studies at the Conservatory and was
looking for pupils. I had two or three for the
piano, and one for English, and these brought me
in sufficient for my expenses. It was under these
circumstances that my mother fell ill; I lost my
pupils because all my time was taken up by caring
for her, and soon found myself in a most distressing
situation. Then when she died I was left alone in
a boarding-house, besieged by men who pestered me
at all hours with shameful proposals. I tramped
the streets in search of a position as teacher. I was
truly in despair. You may well believe that there
were days when I was tempted to commit suicide, to
plunge into an evil life, to embrace any desperate
measure so as to have done with all this brooding.
While in this state I read one day in a newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
that an English lady staying at the Hotel de Paris
desired a young lady companion who had a good
knowledge of Spanish and English. I go to the
hotel, I wait for the lady and she receives me with
open arms and treats me like a sister. You can
understand my satisfaction and gratitude. I have
never been an ingrate; if at that time my benefactress
had asked for my life, I would have surrendered
it with pleasure. You may take my word
for that. This lady was an enthusiastic student of
painting and used to go to the Museo; I accompanied
her. Among those who copied at the Museo
was a young German, tall, fair, and a friend of my
employer. He began to make love to me. He
struck me as swell-headed and not very agreeable.
When my benefactress noticed that the painter was
courting me, she was very much put out and told me
that he was a low fellow, a cynical beast; she drew
me a most horrible picture of him, depicting him as
a depraved egotist. I felt no great sympathy for
the German in the first place, so I heeded my protector’s
words and showed my scorn for the painter
quite openly. Despite this, however, Oswald—that
was his name—persisted in his attentions. It was
at this juncture that Bernardo appeared. I think
he knew the German somewhat, and one day he
spoke to my employer and me. And now, without
my being aware of what was going on, my benefactress
began tactics contrary to those she had employed
in the case of Oswald. She praised Bernardo
to the skies at every least opportunity; she said he
was a great artist, a man of superior talents, of exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
sensibility with a heart of gold; she told me
that he adored me. Indeed, I received enchanting
love letters from him, filled with delicate sentiments
that moved me. My benefactress facilitated our
meetings; she urged me to this unfortunate marriage,
and as soon as I was wed she left Madrid.
Two or three weeks after the ceremony, Bernardo
confessed to me with a laugh that all the letters
he had written to me had been dictated to him by
Fanny.”</p>

<p>“Fanny, you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“I think I do.”</p>

<p>“She was in love with Oswald herself. To keep
Oswald from courting me she had committed a
heartless treachery. After saving me from poverty,
she cast me into a situation even worse than what she
had rescued me from. She abused the blind confidence
I had in her. But I’ll have my revenge; yes,
I’ll have my revenge. Fanny is here with Oswald.
I’ve seen them. I have written to him, making an
appointment for tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“That was a mistake, Esther.”</p>

<p>“Why? Is that the way to play with a person’s
life?”</p>

<p>“But what will you gain by this?”</p>

<p>“Revenge. Does that seem little?”</p>

<p>“Very little. If you’ve retained some affection
for Oswald, that’s a different matter.”</p>

<p>“No, not a bit. I don’t care for him. But I
won’t let Fanny get off without punishment for her
perfidy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“And would you go as far as adultery to get your
revenge?”</p>

<p>“Who told you that it would go as far as
adultery? Besides, in me it would be a right, not a
lapse.”</p>

<p>“What’s more, you’d make Oswald very unhappy?’</p>

<p>“Haven’t they made me unhappy?”</p>

<p>Esther was in the grip of passionate excitement.</p>

<p>“Do you think Oswald will come to this house tomorrow?”
asked Roberto.</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“This benefactress of yours,—is she tall, thin,
with grey eyes?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s my cousin.”</p>

<p>“Your cousin?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I warn you, she’s a very violent woman.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“She’s capable of attacking you anywhere.”</p>

<p>“I know that, too.”</p>

<p>“Have you considered your resolution calmly?
As you will readily understand,—a man to whom
a woman writes making an appointment, and to
whom she says: ‘If I did not respond to your attentions
it was because they deceived me about you,
and told me that you were many things that you
were not,’—such a man cannot resign himself to
listening tranquilly to such a confession.”</p>

<p>“What is he going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“He will look for satisfaction. No one consents
to being the mere, passive instrument of another’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
vengeance. You will ruin this man’s peace
of mind.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they ruin mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But wreaking vengeance for Fanny’s
treachery on her lover doesn’t strike me as just.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter to me. One thing alone
would make me forgo my revenge.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“The fact that it might harm you in any way.
You have been good to me,” murmured Esther,
blushing.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t harm me in any way. But you
could harm yourself. Fanny has a horrible temper.”</p>

<p>“Would you care to come here tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“I? Why, what right have I to meddle?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a friend of mine?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then come.”</p>

<p>Roberto did come the following afternoon.
Bernardo was, as usual, not at home. Esther was
highly excited. Oswald arrived at four. He was a
blond young man, with reddish eyes, very tall and
long-haired. He seemed to suffer an intense disappointment
at finding Roberto alone. They conversed.
To Roberto, Oswald appeared to be an
insufferable pedant. He took the floor to say, in
professorial tones, that he could not endure either
the Spaniards or the French. He was going to
write a book, entitled <i>The Anti-Latin</i>, in which he
would consider the Latin peoples as degenerates who
should be conquered by the Germans, the sooner the
better. He boiled with indignation because folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
spoke of France. France did not exist. France
had accomplished nothing. France had erected
around itself a Chinese wall. As Björnson had said,
a long time before, the world’s greatest composer
was Wagner; the greatest dramatist, Ibsen; the
greatest novelist, Tolstoi; the greatest painter,
Böcklin; yet in France they continued to speak of
Sardou, Mirbeau, and other similar imbeciles. The
original writers of Paris plagiarized Nietzsche; the
Latin composers had copied and ransacked the
Germans; French science did not exist; France had
neither philosophy nor art. France’s historic
achievement was a complete illusion. The whole
Latin race was a matter for scorn.</p>

<p>Roberto made no answer to this diatribe, but
scrutinized Oswald closely instead. This huge pedant
of a fellow struck him as so absurd. A woman
had made an appointment with him and here he was
babbling sociology!</p>

<p>Esther came in. The German saluted her very
gravely, and asked her in an aside the reason for this
appointment. Esther said nothing. Roberto tactfully
left the studio and began to stride up and
down the corridor.</p>

<p>“Does Fanny know now that you’ve come here?”
asked Esther of Oswald.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think she does.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because then she’ll come, too.”</p>

<p>“Has she anything to do with this affair?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Has she been living with you for some
time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for some time.”</p>

<p>They were both silent for a period, mute in so
embarrassing a situation. All at once there came
the sound of the bell being tugged violently.</p>

<p>“Here she comes,” said Esther, opening the door.</p>

<p>Fanny rushed into the studio. She was pale and
upset.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you expecting me?” she asked Esther.</p>

<p>“Yes. I knew that you would come.”</p>

<p>“What do you want of Oswald?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. I want to tell him what sort of
woman you are; I want to inform him about your
treachery, that’s all. You committed against me,
who trusted you as if you were my mother, a vile
crime. You betrayed me. You told me that
Oswald had seduced a woman and then abandoned
her.”</p>

<p>“I!” exclaimed the painter, astounded.</p>

<p>“Yes, you. That’s what she told me. She told
me also that you were an insignificant painter, utterly
lacking in talent.”</p>

<p>Fanny, stupefied, taken unawares, could not say a
word.</p>

<p>“During the time in which you and I were
friends,” Esther continued, turning to Oswald, “she
never missed an opportunity to speak ill of you,
to insult you. She said that you were trying to seduce
me; she painted you as a wicked wretch, a beast,
a repugnant creature....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“You lie! You lie!” shrieked Fanny in a high-pitched
voice.</p>

<p>“I am telling the truth, and only the truth. At
that time I believed your advice was for my good,—dictated
by the affection you felt for me. Afterward
I realized that you had been guilty of the vilest
perfidy,—the most iniquitous that can be committed,
taking advantage of the influence you wielded over
me.”</p>

<p>“But you wrote me a letter,” interposed Oswald.</p>

<p>“Not I.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. A letter in which you replied to
my protestations with cruel jests.”</p>

<p>“No. I didn’t write that letter. Fanny must
have forged it. She wanted to keep you away from
me at all costs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have ruined my life!” cried Oswald with
wild emphasis, falling into a chair near the table and
bowing his head upon his hand. Then he rose from
his seat and began to pace from one side of the room
to the other.</p>

<p>“This is the truth, the pure truth,” affirmed
Esther. “And I wanted you to know it, to hear it
in her presence, so that she could deny nothing. She
made my life unhappy, but she shall not enjoy her
perfidy in peace.”</p>

<p>“You have ruined my life!” repeated Oswald in
his emphatic tone.</p>

<p>“She. It was she.”</p>

<p>“I’ll kill you!” howled Fanny in a hoarse voice,
seizing Esther by the arms.</p>

<p>“But you know now that what she told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
about me was a lie, don’t you?” asked Oswald.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then, will you listen to me now?”</p>

<p>“Now? Ha, ha!” laughed Fanny. “Now she
has a lover.”</p>

<p>“Not at all!” cried Esther.</p>

<p>“Yes you have. He comes here every day to see
you. He’s a blond. You can’t deny it.”</p>

<p>“Ah! He was in here a moment ago,” said
Oswald.</p>

<p>“He’s not my lover. He’s a friend.”</p>

<p>“But why did you call Oswald?” queried Fanny
in fury. “Do you love him?”</p>

<p>“I? No! But I want to show you that you
can’t play with other persons’ lives as you played
with mine. You betrayed me, and now I have
had my revenge.”</p>

<p>“I’ll kill you,” howled Fanny again, and she
seized Esther by the throat.</p>

<p>“Roberto! Roberto!” cried Esther, terrified.</p>

<p>Roberto burst into the studio, grabbed his cousin
by the arm and pulled her violently away from
Esther.</p>

<p>“Ah! It’s you, Bob?” exclaimed Fanny, immediately
growing calm. “You came in the nick of
time. I was going to murder her.”</p>

<p>Roberto’s arrival had the effect of somewhat
tranquillizing the company. The four sat down and
discussed the matter. They analyzed it as if it were
some problem in chess. Fanny loved Oswald.
Oswald was in love with Esther, and Esther did not
feel the slightest inclination toward the painter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
How were they to adjust the situation? Nobody
would yield; besides, as they deliberated they went
astray in labyrinths of psychological analysis that
led nowhere. It had grown dark; Esther lighted
the oil lamp and set it down upon the table. The
discussion continued coldly; Oswald spoke in a monotone.</p>

<p>“You be the judge,” suggested Fanny to Roberto.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that if everyone will go off on his
separate way, each individual conflict will be resolved.
But apart from the moral damage you
have wrought, Fanny, you have done Esther a very
great material injury.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready to indemnify her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want anything from you,” blurted Esther.</p>

<p>“No. Pardon me,” went on Roberto. “Pardon
me for interfering in this matter. You, Fanny,
possess a vast fortune, a lofty position in society;
Esther, on the other hand, finds herself, and all
through your fault, with her future cut off. She
has to earn her living, and you don’t know what
that means. But I, who do know, know how bitter
and sad it is. Esther might have lived a quiet, easy
life. Through your fault she has been reduced to
her present position.”</p>

<p>“I have already said that I’m willing to indemnify
her.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve already said that I don’t want anything
from you.”</p>

<p>“No. You ought to let me settle this affair,
Esther. May I see you tomorrow, Fanny?”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait for you during the whole afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well. We’ll go over this matter.”</p>

<p>Fanny rose to leave; she nodded slightly to
Esther and held out her hand to her cousin.</p>

<p>“No hard feelings?” asked Roberto.</p>

<p>“No hard feelings,” she asserted, giving
Roberto’s hand a violent shake.</p>

<p>Oswald left in company of Fanny, sinister and
humiliated. Esther and Roberto remained alone in
the studio.</p>

<p>“Do you know what?” said Roberto, laughing.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have gained very much by marrying
Oswald instead of Bernardo.... Good-bye,
till tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“You’re forsaking me, Roberto,” murmured
Esther moodily.</p>

<p>“No. I’ll come to see you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to remain in this house. Take me
away from here, Roberto.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that seem dangerous to you?”</p>

<p>“Dangerous? For whom? You or me?”</p>

<p>“For both, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not for me. I want so much to leave this
place, and never see Bernardo,—never have him
bother me.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never bother you again.”</p>

<p>“Take me away from here. Take me anywhere.”</p>

<p>“See here, Esther. I’m a man who travels
through life over a straight path. That’s my sole
strength. I wear blinders, just like horses, and I
don’t go off the road. My two ambitions are to
make a fortune and marry a good woman. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
rest is, to me, merely a delay in the accomplishment
of my aims.”</p>

<p>“And I belong to ... all the rest?”</p>

<p>“Yes. For otherwise you’d make me lose my
way.”</p>

<p>“You’re inflexible.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But I’m inflexible with myself as well.
You’re in a difficult position. You married a man a
year ago,—a man you didn’t love, true enough, but
in the belief that he was a loyal, industrious person
whom in time you would learn to love. That man
has turned out to be a stultified, depraved wretch,
utterly lacking in moral fibre. You’re deeply
wounded in your woman’s pride,—the pride of a
good, energetic woman. I understand that perfectly.
You are looking for a spar to rescue you
from the wreckage.”</p>

<p>“And you come and say to me, coldly: ‘I can’t
be your rescuer; I have other ambitions. If I come
across persons on the way who are suffering agonies
because no one understands them, I turn my head the
other direction and continue on my way.’”</p>

<p>“That’s true. I continue on my way. Would
it be better to go ahead and do what any one else
would, what a gallant man would, in my place?
Take advantage of your plight, get you to become
my mistress and then desert you? I have a conscience.
Perhaps like my ambitions it is single-tracked.
But that’s how it’s made; there’s no help
for it.”</p>

<p>“There’s no salvation; my life is ruined,”
muttered Esther, her eyes moist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not at all. There’s work. Not all men are
base and beastly; struggle on, yes, that’s what life
is! Rather unrest, continual toil and moil, rather
the unending alternation of pleasures and griefs than
stagnation.”</p>

<p>Esther wiped off a tear with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Good-bye. I’ll try to follow your advice,” and
she held out her hand.</p>

<p>Roberto took it, and in his cavalier-like fashion
bowed and kissed it.</p>

<p>He was on the point of leaving when in the voice
of an entreating child she whispered, in anguish:</p>

<p>“Oh! Don’t go!”</p>

<p>Roberto returned.</p>

<p>“I’ll not lead you astray,” cried Esther. “Take
me away from here. No. I’ll not complain. I’ll
be a sister to you,—a servant, if you wish. Do with
me whatever you will, but don’t abandon me. Some
one would come along and take advantage of my
weakness and it would be so much the worse for
me.”</p>

<p>“Let us be off, then,” murmured Roberto,
touched. “Aren’t you going to let Bernardo
know?”</p>

<p>Esther seized a sheet of letter-paper and wrote,
in a large hand: “Don’t wait for me. I’m not
coming back.” Then nervously she put on her hat
and joined Roberto, who was waiting at the door.</p>

<p>“But if you don’t really want to accompany me,
Roberto, please don’t do it. Not through any sense
of obligation, no,” said Esther, her eyes brimming
with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve said you’ll be my sister. Let’s be
going,” he replied, with affection in his voice.
Then she fell upon his bosom. Brushing aside the
curls from her forehead, he kissed her tenderly.</p>

<p>“No, not like that, not like that,” exclaimed
Esther, all atremble, and, seizing Roberto by the
wrists she offered her lips to his.</p>

<p>Roberto lost his head. He kissed her frantically.
Esther encircled his neck with her arms; a deep sigh
of desperation and desire sent tremors rippling
from her head to her feet.</p>

<p>“Shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go.”</p>

<p>They left the house.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Bernardo Santín, with his
wife’s note in his fingers, was muttering:</p>

<p>“And my poor father? What’s going to become
of my poor father now?”</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>General Strike—Gay Times—The Dance at the Frontón—Initiation
Into Love</p>

</div>

<p>Jesús’s sister welcomed most enthusiastically
the two orphans befriended by the compositor
on the day before Christmas; La Salvadora
and the tiny tot became at once part of the family.</p>

<p>La Salvadora was of a shy, yet despotic disposition;
she was so fond of cleaning, sweeping, dusting
and shaking that she provoked Jesús and Manuel.
She loved to arrange and put things in order; she
was as energetic as she was thin. She brought their
meals to Jesús and to Manuel, because they spent
too much at the tavern; at noon she would be off
for the printing-shop with a basket of food that was
bulkier than herself. With the savings of three
months La Fea and La Salvadora purchased a new
sewing-machine at an instalment house.</p>

<p>“That girl isn’t going to let us live in peace,” said
Jesús.</p>

<p>The typesetter’s life had returned to normal.
He no longer got drunk. Yet despite the care
lavished upon him by his sister and La Salvadora,
he became daily more sombre and glum.</p>

<p>One winter’s evening when he had received his
pay and was leaving the shop, Jesús asked Manuel:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“See here. Aren’t you tired of working?”</p>

<p>“Pse!”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you bored stiff by this routine, monotonous
existence?”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>“Anything rather than keep this up!”</p>

<p>“If you were only alone, as I am!”</p>

<p>“La Fea and La Salvadora are on the way to
taking care of themselves,” said Jesús. In the
spring, he added, he and Manuel ought to undertake
a hike over the road, working a bit here and there
and always seeing new faces and new places. He
knew that the Department of the Interior helped
out such travellers with a sum that consisted of two
reales for every town through which they passed.
If they could get such aid they ought to be off at
once.</p>

<p>They were crossing the Plaza del Progreso, engrossed
in this discussion, when a band of strolling
students passed by playing a lilting march. It was
beginning to snow; it was very cold.</p>

<p>“Shall we have a good supper tonight? What do
you say?” asked Jesús.</p>

<p>“They’ll be waiting for us at home.”</p>

<p>“Let ’em wait! A day is a day. Are we going
to stick there all our lives long, skimping, to save
up a few nasty coins? Save! For what?”</p>

<p>They retraced their steps, hurrying along through
the Calle de Barrionuevo, and on the Calle de la
Paz they entered a tavern and ordered supper. As
they ate they discussed their projected journey with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
enthusiasm. They drank several toasts to it.
Manuel had never been so merry. They were fully
agreed, ready to explore the North Pole.</p>

<p>“Now we ought to go to the dance at the Frontón,”
mumbled Jesús at dessert in a stuttering voice.
“We’ll pick up a couple of skirts and whoop ’er up
for a gay old time! As for the printing-shop,—devil
take it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” repeated Manuel. “To the
dance! And let the lame boss go to hell. Get a
move on, you!”</p>

<p>They got up, paid their bill, and as they walked
through the Calle de Caretas they entered another
tavern for a couple of glasses more.</p>

<p>Stumbling against everybody they reached the
Calle de Tetuán, where Jesús insisted that they have
two more glasses. They entered another tavern
and sat down. The compositor was consumed by
a raging thirst: he slouched there, a pallid wreck.
Manuel, on the other hand, felt that his blood was
on fire and his cheeks darted flames.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s be moving,” he said to Jesús.
But the typesetter could not stir. Manuel hesitated
whether to remain there or leave Jesús sleeping with
his head fallen upon the table.</p>

<p>Manuel staggered to the street. The snowflakes,
dancing before his eyes, made him dizzy. He
reached the Puerta del Sol. At the corner of the
Carrera de San Jerónimo he caught sight of a girl
who was accosting men. At first he confused her
with La Rabanitos, but it was not she.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>This girl had a face swollen with erysipelas.</p>

<p>“Hey, what are you doing?” asked Manuel of
her, bruskly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see? I’m selling <i>Heraldos</i>.”</p>

<p>“And nothing else?”</p>

<p>She lowered her voice, which was hoarse and
broken, and added:</p>

<p>“And ready for a good time.”</p>

<p>Manuel’s heart began to throb violently.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a sweetheart?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I don’t want any steadies.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“They take away all the money a girl earns and
then finish up the job with a good beating. Yes,
they do....”</p>

<p>“How much’ll you take for coming along with
me?”</p>

<p>“Ha! There’s a joke for you! Why, you
haven’t a céntimo!”</p>

<p>“Who said so?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I have, too,” muttered Manuel boastfully.
“Five duros to blow and you’re no use to me at all.”</p>

<p>“Neither are you to me.”</p>

<p>“Listen here,” blurted Manuel. Seizing the girl
by the arm he gave her a rude shove.</p>

<p>“Hey, you. Quit that, <i>asaúra</i>!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like it.”</p>

<p>“You’re nobody, you ain’t. And keep your hands
where they belong, d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“If you’re willing, I’ll treat you to coffee,” and
Manuel jingled the money in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl hesitated, then gave the newspapers that
she held in her hand to an old woman. She tied
her kerchief about her neck and went off with
Manuel to a bun shop on the Calle de Jacometrezo.
A cinnamon-hued puppy ran after them.</p>

<p>“Is that your dog?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Sevino.”</p>

<p>“And why do you call him that?”</p>

<p>“Because he walked right into our house without
anybody bringing him.”<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>They entered the bun shop. It was a spacious
place, adorned with columns, at the rear of which
was the kitchen, with its huge caldron for making
buns. Two gas-lights, the burners of which were
surrounded by white globes, shed a sad illumination
upon the walls and the square columns, which were
covered by white tiles bearing blue designs. Manuel
and the girl sat down at a table near a door that
led to a back street.</p>

<p>The girl prattled away at a merry clip as she
dipped pieces of a bitter coffee-cake into the cup of
chocolate. Her name was Petra, but they called her
Matilde because that sounded so much better.
She was sixteen years old and lived on the Calle del
Amparo in an attic. She got up at two; but by the
time she arose her mother had already done the
house chores. She did not go out till evening.
She sold a handful of <i>Heraldos</i> and ten <i>Correos</i>,
and after that ... whatever turned up. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
money she earned she gave to her mother, and when
her mother suspected that she was holding any back,
she caught it hot and heavy.</p>

<p>Manuel sipped his glass of whiskey gravely,
listened to what she said yet understood hardly a
word.</p>

<p>The lass was ugly, in all truth. Her face was
caked with powder. To Manuel, after a long
scrutiny, it occurred that she looked like a fish
smothered in flour, waiting for the frying-pan. As
she spoke she made all manner of grimaces and
moved her white, bulging eyelids, which fell over
her darting eyes.</p>

<p>The girl babbled on about her mother, her
brother, an uncle of hers who owned a news-stand
and every morning advanced a duro to the kids who
sold the <i>Blanco y Negro</i>, requiring the children to
bring back the duro plus a peseta at the end of the
day,—and about a host of other matters.</p>

<p>As she chattered away, Manuel recalled that
Jesús had made some mention of a dance, although
he could no longer remember just where it was to
be held.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to that ball,” he said.</p>

<p>“Which? Over at the Frontón?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Come on.”</p>

<p>They left the bun shop. It was still snowing.
Proceeding through several deserted by-ways they
reached the handball court. The two arc lights at
the entrance threw a powerful illumination upon
the white street. Manuel bought two tickets; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
checked his cape and she her cloak, and they went in.</p>

<p>The Frontón was a large rectangular area, with
one of the longer walls painted a dark blue and
marked at regular intervals with white lines and
numbers. The other long wall supported the tiers
and the boxes.</p>

<p>Two large green screens bounded the shorter
walls of the court. Above, at the top of the high
roof, amidst the iron framework, ten or twelve
glowing arc lamps, free of crystal globes, flashed a
dazzling light.</p>

<p>This vast space, painted a dark hue, looked like
an unoccupied machine shop.</p>

<p>A number of night birds of very low flight, bedecked
with Manila mantles and flowers in their
hair, displayed their busts in the boxes. It was
cold.</p>

<p>When the military band burst into its noisy music
the people from the corridors and from the
restaurant came dancing out on to the floor, and in
a little while the couples were whirling around the
hall. There were no more than half a dozen masks.
The dance grew more animated. By the cold, crude
light from the arc lamps one could see the couples
turning around, all the dancers very solemn, very
stiff, as lugubrious as if they were attending a burial.</p>

<p>Some of the men rested their lips against the
women’s foreheads. But one felt no atmosphere of
passionate desire or fever. It was the dance of a
people in whom life had been extinguished, of puppets
with eyes that bespoke weariness or repressed
anger. At times some wag, as if feeling the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of proving that this was a carnival ball, would
stretch himself out on the floor or let out a piercing
yell. There would be a momentary confusion, but
soon order was restored and the dancing was resumed.</p>

<p>Manuel was filled with an impulse to do something
wild. He got up and began to dance with his
girl. She, however, vexed because he could not
keep in time, went back to her seat. Disconsolate,
Manuel did the same. Couples tripped by before
them; the women with daubed faces and darkened
eyes, with a beastly expression upon their rouged
lips, and the men with an arrogant mien and an aggressive
glance.</p>

<p>Angrily the men ripped through the streamers
that were thrown down from the boxes, entangling
the dancers.</p>

<p>A drunken negro, seated near Manuel, greeted
the passing of some good-looking woman with a
shout that mimicked a child’s voice:</p>

<p>“Olé there! My gipsy baby!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Manolo,” came a voice to Manuel’s ears.
It was Vidal, who was dancing with an elegant mask,
tightly clasping her waist.</p>

<p>“Come see me tomorrow,” said Vidal.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Seven at night, at the Café de Lisboa.”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>Vidal was soon lost with his partner in the whirlpool
of dancers. The music paused for an intermission.</p>

<p>“Shall we leave?” asked Manuel of the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, let’s be going.”</p>

<p>Manuel was all atremble with emotion at thought
that the tragic moment was approaching. They
went to the check-room, got their clothes and left.</p>

<p>It was still snowing. The light from the electric
globes over the door of the Frontón illuminated the
street, which was covered with a white sheet of
snow. Manuel and the girl crossed the Puerta del
Sol in haste, went up the Calle de Correos, turned
into the Calle de la Paz and stopped before an open
gate which was lighted by the half confidential, half
mysterious glow that came from a large, very
lugubrious lantern.</p>

<p>They pushed aside a glass door and disappeared
up the dark staircase.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Snow—More Tales From Don Alonso—<i>Las Injurias</i>—The
<i>Asilo del Sur</i></p>

</div>

<p>Manuel slept like a log the whole of the
following morning. Indeed, when he got
up it was past three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He knocked at Jesús’s door. La Fea was at the
machine and La Salvadora was sitting in a tiny chair
ripping some skirts; the tot was playing on the floor.</p>

<p>“Where’s Jesús?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“I guess you know better than we do,” retorted
La Salvadora, her voice quivering with anger.</p>

<p>“I ... left him ...; then I met a friend....”
Manuel forced himself to invent a lie. “Perhaps
he’s at the shop,” he added.</p>

<p>“No. He’s not at the printing shop,” replied
La Salvadora.</p>

<p>“I’ll go look for him.”</p>

<p>Manuel left the hostelry of Santa Casilda in
shame. He walked toward the heart of the city
and asked for his friend at the tavern on the Calle
de Tetuán.</p>

<p>“He was here,” answered the waiter, “until the
place closed. Then he went off as drunk as a lord,
I don’t know where.”</p>

<p>Manuel returned to the house, and went back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
bed with the intention of going to the printing shop
on the next day. But the following day he awoke
late again. He was overcome by an inertia that
seemed impossible to conquer.</p>

<p>He came upon La Salvadora in the corridor.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you gone to the shop today, either?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then. Don’t trouble yourself ever to
come back here again,” rasped the girl, furiously.
“We don’t need any tramps. While we’re here
slaving away, you fellows go out for a gay time.
I’m telling you, now, don’t ever show up here
again, and if you see Jesús, tell him the same for
his sister and for me.”</p>

<p>Manuel shrugged his shoulders and left the
house. It had been snowing all day. In the Puerta
del Sol gangs of street-sweepers and hose men
were clearing away the drifts; the filthy water ran
along the gutters.</p>

<p>Several times Manuel stepped into the Café de
Lisboa, hoping to come upon Vidal. Not finding
him there he had a bite at a tavern, after which he
went for a stroll through the streets. It got dark
very early. Madrid, enveloped in snow, was deserted.
The Plaza de Oriente looked unreal,
somewhat like a scene set upon a stage. The monarchs
of stone wore white cloaks. The statue in the
centre of the square stood out nobly against the sky
of grey. From the Viaduct there was a view of
white expanses. Toward Madrid lay a heap of
yellowish structures and black roofs, of towers jutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
into the milky heavens, reddened by a luminous
irradiation.</p>

<p>Manuel returned to the house in low spirits; he
threw himself into bed.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow I’m going back to the shop,” he
said to himself. But on the morrow he did not go
back. He rose very early with that intention, and
was actually about to enter the printery when the
idea occurred to him that the boss might raise a
rumpus, so he turned away. “If not here, then I’ll
find work elsewhere,” he thought, and he turned his
steps back in the direction of the Puerta del Sol,
proceeding thence to the Plaza de Oriente, through
the Calle de Bailén, and the Calle de Ferraz to the
Paseo de Rosales. The avenue was silent and
deserted.</p>

<p>From this point could be viewed the entire landscape
white under the snow, the dark groves of the
Casa de Campo, and the round hills bristling with
black pine trees. The pallid sun hovered in a
leaden sky. Near the horizon, in the direction of
Villaverde, shone a strip of clear blue sky in a pink
mist. Profound silence everywhere. Only the
strident whistle of the locomotives and the hammering
in the workshops of the Estación del Norte
disturbed that calm. Not a footfall resounded on
the pavement.</p>

<p>The houses along the avenue displayed snowy
adornments upon balustrade and coping; the trees
seemed to flatten under that white mantle.</p>

<p>That afternoon Manuel returned toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
printing-shop, ventured inside and asked the pressman
for Jesús.</p>

<p>“He got a fierce call-down from the boss,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“Did he fire him?”</p>

<p>“Maybe not! Go up now and take <em>your</em>
medicine.”</p>

<p>Manuel, about to go up, paused.</p>

<p>“Has Jesús gone already?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He must be in the corner tavern.”</p>

<p>And he really was. He sat before a table drinking
a glass of whisky. There was a sad, doleful expression
upon his face. He was a prey to his
sombre thoughts.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Did the old cripple discharge you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Were you thinking of anything?”</p>

<p>“Pse!... There’s nothing doing, anyway.
Come on, let’s have a glass or two.”</p>

<p>“No, not for me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do as you’re told. I’ve got only forty
céntimos, which is as good as nothing. Hey,
waiter! A couple of glasses.”</p>

<p>They drank and then walked off in the direction
of the Santa Casilda hostelry. It was still snowing.
Jesús, his cheeks hectic, coughed desperately.</p>

<p>“I warn you: Salvadora, that little kid, will raise
holy hell,” said Manuel. “Such a temper she has!”</p>

<p>“Well, what do they want? To have us saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
up money all our lives? I’m glad that the kid is
in the house, for she can take care of La Fea, who
is the unhappier of the two.... And you,—how
much have you got left from your pay?” asked the
compositor of Manuel.</p>

<p>“Me? Not even a button.”</p>

<p>At this reply Jesús was so deeply moved that he
seized his companion by the arm and assured him in
the most ardent outbursts that he esteemed him and
loved him as a brother.</p>

<p>“And may I be damned!” he concluded, “if I’m
not willing to do anything under the sun for you.
For this telling me that you haven’t even a button
is worth more to me than all the deeds of the hero
of Cascorro.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Manuel, affected by these words, asseverated in a
husky voice that though he was a vagabond and a
good-for-nothing, he was ready to perform any sacrifice
for so staunch a friend.</p>

<p>In order to celebrate such tender protestations of
amity, they both lurched into a tavern on the
Calle de Barrionuevo and gulped down a few more
glasses of whisky.</p>

<p>They reached the Santa Casilda hostelry dead
drunk. The house janitor came out to meet them,
demanding of each the rent for his room. Jesús
answered jestingly that they gave him no money because
they had none to give. He rejoined that
either they paid or they could take to the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
whereupon the compositor dared him to throw them
out.</p>

<p>The man’s wife, who might have been a soldier,
took them both by the shoulder and shoved them
into the street.</p>

<p>“Lord, oh Lord! The weaker sex!” mumbled
Jesús. “That’s what they call the weaker sex!...
And they can throw a fellow out of the house....
And where’s a guy going to get two duros?...
Well, what do you say to that, Manuel? Hey?
The weaker sex.... How do you like such a
figurative manner of speech?... It’s we who are
the weaker, and they simply abuse their strength.”</p>

<p>They began to stagger along the street; neither
felt the cold.</p>

<p>From time to time Jesús would pause and deliver
a diatribe; a man would laugh as they passed by, or
a youngster, from some doorway, would call after
them and send a snowball in their direction.</p>

<p>“I wonder whom they’re laughing at?” thought
Manuel.</p>

<p>The Ronda was silent, white, cut by a dark stream
of water left by the carts. The large flakes came
falling down, interweaving in their descent; they
danced in the gusts of wind like white butterflies.
During the intervals of calm they would glide slowly,
softly through the greyish atmosphere, like the
gentle down from the neck of a swan.</p>

<p>Afar, in the mist, lay the white landscape of the
suburbs, the gently curving slopes, the houses and
the cemeteries of the Campo de San Isidro. Against
this background everything stood out more distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
than ordinarily: the roofs, the mudwalls, the trees,
the lanterns thickly hooded in snow.</p>

<p>In this whitish ambient the black smoke belched
forth by the chimneys spread through the air like
a threat.</p>

<p>“The weaker sex. Hey, Manuel?” continued
Jesús, harping upon his fixed idea. “And yet they
can show a fellow to the door.... It’s as if they
said the weak snow.... Because you tread upon
it.... Isn’t that so?... But the snow makes
you cold.... And then who’s the weaker, you or
the snow?... You, because you catch cold.
That’s all a fellow does in this world,—catch cold....
Everything is cold, understand?... Everything....
Like the snow.... Do you see how
white it is, eh? It looks so good, so affectionate
... the weaker sex.... Well, touch it, and you
freeze.”</p>

<p>They squandered their last céntimos on another
glass of whisky, and from that moment they were
no longer conscious of their doings.</p>

<p class="tb">The following morning they awoke frozen
through and through, in a shed of the Cattle Market
situated near the Paseo de los Pontones.</p>

<p>Jesús was coughing horribly.</p>

<p>“You stay here,” said Manuel to him. “I’m
going to see whether I can pick up something to eat.”</p>

<p>He went out to the Ronda. The snow had
ceased. Several gamins were amusing themselves
by throwing snowballs at one another. He went up
the Calle del Águila; the cobbler’s was closed. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
then occurred to Manuel to hunt out Jacob; he
turned toward the Viaduct and was walking along
absent-mindedly when he felt some one grab him by
the shoulders and cry:</p>

<p>“Stay thy hand, Abraham. Where are you
bound?”</p>

<p>It was the Snake-Man, the illustrious Don
Alonso.</p>

<p>Manuel told him what straits he and Jesús were
in.</p>

<p>“Don’t give up; better times are coming,” mumbled
the Snake-Man. “Have you any place to go
to?”</p>

<p>“A shed.”</p>

<p>“Good. Let’s go there. I’ve got a peseta.
That’s enough to get the three of us a bite.”</p>

<p>They went into a chop house on the Calle del
Águila where, for two reales, they received a pot of
stew; they bought bread and then the pair made
quickly for the shed. They ate, laid aside something
for the night, and after their meal Don Alonso
tore loose several pickets from a fence and succeeded
in starting a fire inside the shed.</p>

<p>That afternoon it began to rain in torrents; the
Snake-Man considered it his duty to enliven the
company, so he told one tale after the other, always
commencing with his eternal refrain of “Once
in America....”</p>

<p>“Once in America”—(and this is the least unlikely
tale of all he told)—“we were sailing down
the Mississippi on a steamer. And let me tell
you, those steamboats rock so little that you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
play billiards on them. Well, we were sailing
along and we reach a certain town. The boat
stops and we see a mob of people on the wharf of
that village. We draw nearer and we behold that
they’re all Indians, with the exception of a few
guards and Yankee soldiers.</p>

<p>“I” (and Don Alonso added this information
proudly) “who was the director, said to my
musicians, ‘We must start a lively tune,’ and right
away, Boom! Boom! Tra, la, la!... You can’t
imagine the shouts and the shrieks and the croaking
of that crowd.</p>

<p>“When the band had stopped playing, a big fat
Indian squaw with her head full of cock feathers
steps up to me and begins to make ceremonial greetings.
I asked one of the Yankees, ‘Who is this
lady?’ ‘She’s the queen,’ he said, ‘and she wants
a little more music.’ I saluted the queen. Most
excellent lady! (And I made an elegant series of
Versaillesque bows, setting one foot back.) I said
to the members of the band, ‘Boys, a little more
music for her Majesty.’ They started up again, and
the queen, highly pleased, saluted me with her hand
on her heart. I did the same. Most excellent
lady!</p>

<p>“We put up our portable circus in a few hours and
I withdrew to ponder over the programme. I was
the director. ‘We’ll have to give The Mounted
Indian,’ I said to myself. Even though it’s a discredited
number in the cities, they can’t know it here.
Then I’ll exhibit my ecuyères, acrobats, equilibrists,
pantomimists and, as a finale, the clowns, who will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the climax of the show. The fellow who was to
play The Mounted Indian I tipped off and said,
‘See here, make yourself up to look as much like our
audience as possible.’ ‘Don’t worry about that,
director,’ he answered. Boys! It was a sensational
success. When the ‘Indian’ appeared,
what a racket of applause!”</p>

<p>Don Alonso mimed the number; he crouched, imitating
the movements of one about to mount a
horse; he sank his head in his chest, staring at a
fixed point and imitated the whirling of a lasso
above his head.</p>

<p>“The Mounted Indian,” continued Don Alonso,
“won the applause of the other Indians. I’m positive
that not one of them knew how to ride a horse.
Then there was an acrobatic number, followed by a
variety of others, until the time for the clowns came
around. ‘Here’s where there’s pandemonium,’ I
thought to myself. And surely enough, all they
had to do was appear when a wild tumult broke
loose. ‘They’re having a wonderful time,’ I said
to myself, when in comes a boy. ‘Director, Señor
Director!’ ‘What’s the trouble?’ ‘The whole
audience is leaving.’ ‘Leaving?’ And indeed, they
were. The Indians had become scared at sight of
the clowns, and imagined that they were evil
spirits come there to spoil the performance for
them. I jump into the ring, and send the clowns
stumbling off. Then, to efface the bad impression,
I performed several sleight-of-hand tricks. When
I began to belch ribbons of flame from my mouth,
Lord, what a triumph! The whole house was astounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
But when I palmed a couple of rings and
then drew out of my coat pocket a fish-bowl filled
with live fishes, I received the greatest ovation of
my career.”</p>

<p>Don Alonso was silent. Jesús and Manuel prepared
to go to sleep, stretched out on the ground,
huddled into a corner. The rain came down in
bucketfuls; the water drummed loudly upon the roof
of the shed; the wind whistled and moaned from
afar.</p>

<p>It began to thunder, and it was for all the world
as if some train were crashing headlong down a
metal slope, so continuous, so violent was the thundering.</p>

<p>“A fine tempest!” grunted Jesús.</p>

<p>“Bah! Tempests on land!” sniffed Don Alonso.
“Cheap stuff! Tempests on land are mere imitations.
At sea,—that’s where you want to witness
a tempest, at sea! when the waves come sweeping
over the masts.... Even on the lakes. On Lake
Erie and Lake Michigan I’ve been through tremendous
storms, with waves as high as houses.
But I must admit that the wind goes down almost at
once and in a little while the water is as smooth as
the pond of the Retiro. Why, once yonder in
America....”</p>

<p>But Manuel and Jesús, weary of American tales,
pretended to be fast asleep and the former Snake-Man
sank into disconsolate silence, thinking of the
days when he palmed the Indians’ rings and drew
forth fish-bowls.</p>

<p>They could not sleep; several times they had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
get up and change their places, for the water leaked
through the roof.</p>

<p>On the following morning, when they left their
hole, it was no longer raining. The snow had been
melted completely. The Cattle Market was transformed
into a swamp; the pavement of the Ronda,
into a sea of mud; the houses and the trees dripped
water; everything was black, miry, abandoned;
only a few wandering, famished, mud-stained dogs
were sniffing about in the heaps of refuse.</p>

<p>Manuel pawned his cape and on the advice of
Jesús protected his chest with several layers of newspaper.
For his cape he was allowed ten reales at
a pawnbroker’s, and the three went off to eat at the
Shelter of the Montaña del Príncipe Pío.</p>

<p>Manuel and Jesús, accompanied by Don Alonso,
went into two printing shops and inquired after
work, but there was none. At night they went back
to the shelter for supper. Don Alonso suggested
that they go to the beggars’ Depósito. Thither the
three wended their way; it was dusk; before
the doors of the Depósito there was a long
row of tattered ragamuffins, waiting for them
to open; Jesús and Manuel were opposed to going
in.</p>

<p>They walked through the little wood near the
Montaña barracks; some soldiers and prostitutes
were chatting and smoking in a group. They went
along the Calle de Ferraz, then along Bailén; they
crossed the Viaduct, and going through the Calle
de Toledo, reached the Paseo de los Pontones.</p>

<p>The corner of the shed where they had spent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
previous night was now occupied by a crew of young
vagabonds.</p>

<p>They resumed their trudging through the mud;
it began to rain anew. Manuel proposed that they
go to La Blasa’s tavern, and by the staircase of the
Paseo Imperial they descended to the quarters
of Las Injurias. The tavern was closed. They
walked down a lane. Their feet sank into mud and
pools of water. They noticed a hovel with an open
door; they went inside. The Snake-Man struck a
match. The place had two rooms, each a couple of
metres square. The walls of the dingy dens oozed
dampness and slime; the floor, of tamped earth,
was riddled with the constant dripping and covered
with puddles. The kitchen was a cess-pool of pestilence;
in the centre rose a mound of refuse and excrement;
in the corners, dead, desiccated cockroaches.</p>

<p>The next morning they left the house. It was
a damp, dreary day; afar, the fields lay wrapped in
mist. Las Injurias district was depopulated; its
denizens were on their way through the muddy lanes
to Madrid, on the hunt. Some ascended to the
Paseo Imperial, others trooped down though the
Arroyo de Embajadores.</p>

<p>They were a repulsive rout; some, ragpickers;
others, mendicants; still others, starvelings; almost
all of them of nauseating mien. Worse in appearance
than the men were the women,—filthy, dishevelled,
tattered. This was human refuse, enfolded
in rags, swollen with cold and dankness, vomited
up by this pest-ridden quarter. Here was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
medley of skin-diseases, marks left by all the ailments
to which the flesh is heir, the jaundiced hue
of tertian fever, the contracted eyelash,—all the
various stigmata of illness and poverty.</p>

<p>“If the rich could only see this, eh?” asked Don
Alonso.</p>

<p>“Bah! They’d do nothing,” muttered Jesús.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because they wouldn’t. If you were to deprive
the rich man of the satisfaction of knowing that
while he sleeps another is freezing, and that while
he eats another is dying of hunger, you would deprive
him of half his pleasure and good fortune.”</p>

<p>“Do you really believe that?” asked Don Alonso,
staring in astonishment at Jesús.</p>

<p>“I certainly do. What’s more,—why should
we bother with what they may think? They don’t
give themselves any concern over us. At this hour
they must be sleeping in their clean, soft beds, so
peacefully, while we....”</p>

<p>The Snake-Man made a gesture of displeasure; he
was vexed that any one should speak ill of the rich.</p>

<p>The sun came out: a disk of red over the black
earth. Then carts began to arrive at the Gas
Work’s dumping grounds and to dump rubbish and
refuse. Here and there in the doorways of the
hovels that filled the hollow appeared a woman
with a cigar in her mouth.</p>

<p>One night the watchman of Las Injurias discovered
the three men in the abandoned shanty and
ejected them.</p>

<p>The following days, Manuel and Jesús—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
showman had disappeared—decided to go to the
Asilo de las Delicias for the night. Neither was
at all bent upon finding work. It was already almost
a month since they had taken to this tramp’s existence,
and between one day at a barracks and the
next in a monastery or a shelter, they managed to
keep going.</p>

<p>The first time that Jesús and Manuel slept in the
Asilo de las Delicias was a March day.</p>

<p>When they reached the Asilo it had not yet
opened. They passed their wait strolling along
the old Yeseros road. They wandered into the
fields nearby, where they saw wretched shacks in the
doorways of which some men were playing at <i>chito</i>
or <i>tejo</i>, while bands of ragged children swarmed
about.</p>

<p>These by-roads were gloomy, bleak, desolate
spots,—the abode of ruins, as if a city had been
reared there and been annihilated by a cataclysm.
On all sides were heaps of refuse and débris, gullies
filled with rubbish; here and there a broken stone
chimney, a shattered lime-kiln. Only at rare intervals
might one catch a glimpse of a garden with
its draw-well; in the distance, on the hills that
bounded the horizon, rose the dim suburbs and scattered
houses. It was a disquieting vicinity; behind
the hillock one came suddenly upon evil-looking
vagabonds in groups of three or four.</p>

<p>Through a little gorge nearby flowed the
Abroñigal, a rivulet; Manuel and Jesús followed
it until they reached a stone bridge called Tres
Ojos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>They returned at night. The shelter was already
open. It was on the right hand side of the Yeseros
road, in the vicinity of a number of abandoned
cemeteries. Its pointed roof, its galleries and
wooden staircases, lent it the appearance of a Swiss
châlet. On the balcony was a signboard attached
to the balustrade, reading: “Asilo Municipal del
Sur.” A lantern with a red glass shed its gory
light upon the deserted fields.</p>

<p>Manuel and Jesús went down several steps; at a
counter a clerk who was scribbling away in a big
book asked them their names; they replied and
then entered the institution. The section for men
consisted of two large rooms lit by gas-burners,
separated by a partition wall; each had wooden
pillars and high, tiny windows. Jesús and Manuel
crossed the first room and went into the second,
where there were several men stretched out here and
there upon the beds. They, too, lay down and
chatted for a while....</p>

<p>As they spoke, a number of beggars kept coming
in, taking possession of the beds that were placed in
the middle of the room and near the pillars. These
new arrivals dropped on to the floor their coats,
their patched capes, their filthy undershirts,—a heap
of tatters,—at the same time depositing tin cans
filled with cigarette ends, pots and baskets.</p>

<p>Almost all the patrons of the place went into the
second room.</p>

<p>“There isn’t such a draught in this room,” said
an old beggar who was preparing to lie down near
Manuel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Several ragamuffins between fifteen and twenty
years of age burst into the place, took possession of
a corner and settled down to a game of <i>cané</i>.</p>

<p>“You bunch of rascals!” cried the old beggar near
Manuel. “You had to choose this place to come
and gamble in. Damn it!”</p>

<p>“Wow! Listen to what old Wrinkle-face is bawling
about now!” retorted one of the gamins.</p>

<p>“Shut your mouth, Old Bore! You’re as bad as
Don Nicanor pounding his drum,” jeered another.</p>

<p>“Tramps! Vagabonds!” growled the old fellow
angrily.</p>

<p>Manuel turned toward the fuming old man. He
was a diminutive creature, with a sparse, greyish
beard; he had a pair of eyes that looked like scars
and black spectacles that reached to the middle of
his forehead. He wore a patched, grimy coat; a
flat, woolen cap, on top of which sat a derby with
a greasy brim. As he had entered, he had disburdened
himself of a canvas bag which he dropped
to the floor.</p>

<p>“It’s these whippersnappers that get us in
wrong,” explained the old man. “Last year they
robbed the shelter telephone and stole a piece of
lead from a water-pipe.”</p>

<p>Manuel swept the room with his glance. Near
him, a tall old fellow with a white beard and the
features of an apostle, leaned his shoulder against
one of the pillars, immersed in his thoughts; he wore
a smock, a muffler and a cap. In the corner occupied
by the impudent, blustering ragamuffins rose
the silhouette of a man garbed in black,—the type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of a retired official. On his knees reposed the
head of a slumbering boy of five or six.</p>

<p>All the rest were of bestial appearance; beggars
that looked like highwaymen; maimed and crippled
who roamed the streets exhibiting their deformities;
unemployed labourers, now inured to idleness,
amongst whom was an occasional specimen of a
ruined gentleman, with straggling beard and greasy
locks, whose bearing and apparel,—collar, cravat
and cuffs, filthy as they might be,—still recalled a
certain distinction,—a pallid reflection of the
splendour that once had been.</p>

<p>The air in the room very soon grew hot, and the
atmosphere, saturated with the odour of tobacco and
poverty, became nauseating.</p>

<p>Manuel lay back in his cot and listened to the
conversation that had sprung up between Jesús and
the old man with the black spectacles. The fellow
was an inveterate beggar, a connoisseur in all the
arts of exploiting official charity.</p>

<p>Despite his continuous wanderings hither and
thither, he had never been more than five or six
leagues away from Madrid.</p>

<p>“Once upon a time this shelter was a good place,”
he explained to Jesús. “There was a stove; each
cot had its woollen blanket, and in the morning
everybody got a good plate of soup.”</p>

<p>“Yes, water soup,” sneered another beggar, a
young, thin, long-haired lad whose cheeks were
browned by the sun.</p>

<p>“Even so. It warmed a fellow’s innards.”</p>

<p>The man of refinement, doubtless disgusted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
find himself amid this rout of ragamuffins, took the
sleeping child in his arms and drew near to the place
occupied by Manuel and Jesús. He joined the conversation
and began to relate his tribulations. Sad
as his story was, there was yet something comical
about it.</p>

<p>He came from a provincial capital, having left a
modest position and believed in the words of the district
deputy, who promised him a situation in the
offices of the Ministry. For two months he tagged
at the heels of the deputy; at the end of this time he
found himself face to face with the direst poverty,
absolutely without influence or recourse. In the
meantime he was writing to his wife, inspiring her
with hope.</p>

<p>The previous day he had been thrown out of his
boarding-house and after having tramped over half
of Madrid without finding a way to earn a peseta,
had gone to the authorities and asked for an officer
to conduct him and his child to some shelter. “I
take only beggars to the shelter,” was the guard’s
reply. “I’m going out begging,” answered the man
humbly, “so you can take me.” “No,” was the
officer’s answer. “First you must actually beg, then
I’ll arrest you.”</p>

<p>The officer was intractable. At this moment a
man happened to be going by. The father approached
him with his child, brought his hand to his
hat, but the request could not issue from his lips.
It was then that the guard advised him to go to the
Asilo de las Delicias.</p>

<p>“If they’d arrested you, you’d have gained nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
by it,” said the fellow with the black spectacles.
“They’d have taken you off to the Cerro del Pimiento,
and you’d have spent the livelong day there
without so much as a crumb.”</p>

<p>“And then what would they have done with me?”
asked the gentleman of refinement.</p>

<p>“Expel you from Madrid.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t there places here where a person can
spend the night?” asked Jesús.</p>

<p>“A raft of them,” replied the old man. “Everywhere
you go. Especially now, when it’s so cold in
the winter.”</p>

<p>“I’ve lived,” chimed in the young beggar, “for
more than half a year in Vaciamadrid,—an almost
depopulated town. A comrade of mine and myself
found a house that was closed, and we installed ourselves
in it. For a few weeks we lived swimmingly.
At night we’d go to the Arganda station; we’d bore
a hole with an auger in a cask of wine, fill up our
wine-bag and then stuff the hole with pitch.”</p>

<p>“And why did you leave the place?” queried
Manuel.</p>

<p>“The civil guard laid siege to us and we were
forced to escape through the windows. I’ll be
damned if I wasn’t already tired of the joint. I like
to roam along the road, one day here, another there.
That’s the way a fellow meets people who know a
thing or two, and picks up an education....”</p>

<p>“Have you done much tramping hereabouts?”</p>

<p>“All my life. I can’t use up more than one pair
of sandals per town. If I stay very long in the
same place I grow so uneasy that I just have to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
a move on. Ah! The country! There’s nothing
like it. You eat where you can. In winter it’s
tough. But summer time! You make your thyme
bed underneath a tree and have a magnificent sleep,
better than the king himself. When the cold comes
around, then, like the swallows, off you fly to
wherever it’s nice and warm.”</p>

<p>The old man with the black spectacles, scornful
of what the young vagabond had said, informed
Jesús as to the nooks to be found in the outlying
districts.</p>

<p>“Now let me tell you where I go when it’s fine
weather. There’s a cemetery near the third
Depósito. There are some houses there that we’ll
go to this spring.”</p>

<p>The conclusion of the conversation reached
Manuel in but a confused form, as he had fallen
asleep. At midnight he was awakened by some
voices. In the corner to which the ragamuffins had
repaired two boys were rolling over the floor in a
hand to hand struggle.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you,” muttered one between his teeth.</p>

<p>“Let go. You’re choking me.”</p>

<p>The old mendicant, who had been awakened, got
up in a fury and, seizing his stick, let it fall hard
upon the shoulder of one of the boys. The youth
who was struck down rose up, roaring with anger.</p>

<p>“Come on, now, you pig! You son of a dirty
bitch!” he shrieked.</p>

<p>They rushed for each other, exchanged several
blows and then both fell headlong to the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“These young tramps are getting us in wrong,”
exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p>A guard re-established order and expelled the
trouble-makers. The denizens of the shelter were
again calm and nothing more was heard save the
muffled or sibilant snoring of the sleepers....</p>

<p>The next morning, even before daybreak, when
the doors of the Asilo were opened, every one who
had spent the night there left the place and had in a
moment disappeared into the outskirts.</p>

<p>Manuel and Jesús chose the Calle de Mendez
Alvaro. On the platforms of the Estación del
Mediodía the electric arcs shone like globes of light
in the gloomy atmosphere of the night.</p>

<p>From the chimneys of the roundhouse rose dense
pillars of white smoke; the red and green pupils of
the signal lamps winked confidentially from their
lofty poles; the straining boilers of the locomotives
sent forth most horrible roars.</p>

<p>On both sides along the perspective of the thoroughfare
quivered the pale lights of the distant
street lamps. Yonder in the country, through the
air that was as murky and yellowish as ground
glass, could be made out upon the colourless fields,
low cottages, black picket fences, high gnarled
telegraph poles, distant, obscure embankments that
formed the railroad bed. A few ramshackle
taverns, lighted by a languidly burning oil lamp,
were open.... With the opaque glow of dawn
appeared, to the right, the wide, leaden roof of the
Estación del Mediodía, glistening with dew; opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the pile of the General Hospital, jaundice-hued;
to the left, the barren fields, the indistinct
brown vegetable patches that rose until they blended,
with the undulating hills of the horizon under the
grey, humid sky, into the vast desolation of the
Madrilenian suburbs....</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Black House—Conflagration—Flight</p>

</div>

<p>Near the station stretched a line of carriages;
the cabmen had lighted a fire.
Here Jesús and Manuel warmed themselves
for a moment.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go to that town,” muttered Jesús.</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“That uninhabited place the fellow was telling us
about. Vaciamadrid.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready.”</p>

<p>A train had just pulled into the station, so Manuel
and Jesús took up a position at the entrance, where
the passengers were coming out; they hoped to earn
a few coins by carrying some valise.</p>

<p>Manuel was lucky enough to lug a gentleman’s
bundle to a carriage, for which service he received a
modest fee.</p>

<p>Manuel and Jesús proceeded now to the Prado.
They were passing the Museo when they beheld a
hackman whipping up his horses, and, behind the
carriage, running with all his might, Don Alonso,
dressed in a suit that seemed nothing but rents and
tatters.</p>

<p>“Hey, there!” shouted Manuel to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Don Alonso turned around, came to a stop and
walked back to Jesús and Manuel.</p>

<p>“Where were you bound in such a hurry?” they
asked him.</p>

<p>“I was after that carriage, to carry up the gentleman’s
trunk for him. But I’m exhausted. My legs
are caving in.”</p>

<p>“And what are you doing?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Pse!... Starving to death.”</p>

<p>“Better times haven’t come yet?”</p>

<p>“Will they ever come? Napoleon met his finish
at Waterloo, didn’t he? Well, my life is one continuous
Waterloo.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing now?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been selling smutty books. I ought to
have one here,” he added, showing Manuel a
pamphlet, the title of which read: “The Wiles of
Women on The First Night.”</p>

<p>“Is that a good one?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Oh, so so. Let me warn you beforehand that
you’re supposed to read only every other line. To
think of me, fallen to such things! I, who have
been director of a circus in <i>Niu Yoc</i>!”</p>

<p>“Better times are coming.”</p>

<p>“A few nights ago I went out staggering,
famished, and made my way to an Emergency Hospital.
‘What’s the matter with you?’ I was asked
by an attendant. ‘Hunger.’ ‘That’s not a disease,’
he replied. Then I went begging and now I go
every night to the Salamanca quarter, and I tell passing
women that a little boy of mine has just died and
that I need a few reales with which to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
candles. They are horrified and usually come across
with something. I’ve also found a place to sleep.
It’s over yonder by the river.”</p>

<p>The trio ate their next meal at the María Cristina
barracks, and in the afternoon the Snake-Man left
for his centre of operations in the Salamanca
quarter.</p>

<p>“I’ve made a peseta and a half today,” he said to
Manuel and Jesús. “Let’s go for supper.”</p>

<p>They supped at the Barcelona hostelry, on the
Calle del Caballero de Gracia, and spent whatever
was left on whisky.</p>

<p>Thereupon they repaired to the spot that had
been discovered by Don Alonso,—a tumbledown
dwelling near the Toledo bridge. They christened
it the Black House. Nothing was left of it save the
four walls, which had been levelled to the height of
the first story.</p>

<p>It stood in the centre of an orchard; for roof it
had a wattle over which projected a number of
beams as black and straight as smokestacks.</p>

<p>The three entered the ruin. They crossed the
patio, leaping over débris, tiles, rotten wood and
mounds of ordure. They made their way through
a corridor. Don Alonso struck a match, holding it
lighted in the hollow of his palms. Some gipsy
families and several beggars dwelt here in secret.
Some had made their beds of rags and straw; others
were asleep, leaning against matweed ropes that
were fastened to the wall.</p>

<p>Don Alonso had his special corner, to which he
took Manuel and Jesús.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The floor was damp, earthen; a few of the house
walls were still standing; the holes in the roof were
plugged with bunches of cane that had been gathered
by the river, and with pieces of matting.</p>

<p>“Deuce take it all!” exclaimed Don Alonso as he
stretched himself out. “A fellow has always got to
be on the lookout for a place. If I could only be a
snail!”</p>

<p>“Why a snail?” queried Jesús.</p>

<p>“If only to get out of paying bills for lodgings.”</p>

<p>“Better times are coming,” promised Manuel,
ironically.</p>

<p>“That’s the only hope,” replied the Snake-Man.
“By tomorrow our luck may have shifted. You
don’t know life. Fate is to man what the wind is to
the weathervane.”</p>

<p>“The trouble is,” grumbled Jesús, “that our
weathervane, when it isn’t pointing to hunger, is
pointing to cold and always to poverty and wretchedness.”</p>

<p>“Things may change tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The trio fell asleep in the lap of these flattering
illusions. Manuel awoke at daybreak; the light of
the dawn filtered in through the spaces of the wattle
that served as roof, and with this pale glow the
interior of the Black House assumed a sinister
aspect.</p>

<p>They slept in a bunch, rolled up in a ball of rags
and newspaper sheets. Some of the men sought out
the women in the semi-gloom, and their grunts of
pleasure could be heard.</p>

<p>Near Manuel a woman whose features betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
idiocy as well as physical degeneration, begrimed
and garbed in patches, was cradling a child in her
arms. She was a beggar, still young,—one of those
poor wandering creatures who roam over the road
without direction or goal, at the mercy of fate.</p>

<p>The opening of her dirty waist revealed a flat,
blackish bosom. One of the gipsy youths glided
over to her and seized her by the breast. She laid
the infant to one side and stretched herself out on
the floor....</p>

<p class="tb">Just before the dawn of one April day the cold
was so terrible inside the Black House that they
made a fire. The flames leaped high, and at the
moment least expected the wattle roof blazed up.
At once the fire spread. As the canes burned they
burst with an explosion. Soon a vast flame had
risen into the air.</p>

<p>The denizens escaped in terror. Manuel, Jesús
and Don Alonso made their way quickly through the
Paseo de los Pontones to the Ronda.</p>

<p>The blazing roof shone through the dark night
like a gigantic torch. Soon, however, it was extinguished,
and only sparks were left, leaping and
flying through the air.</p>

<p>The three walked along the Ronda. Yonder they
could see the long lines of gas lanterns, and at intervals,
luminous points like shining islands dotting the
obscurity. On the solitary Ronda could be heard,
very rarely, the hastening footsteps of some
passerby and the distant barking of the dogs.</p>

<p>It occurred to Manuel to go to La Blasa’s tavern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Instead of taking the Paseo Imperial, they entered
Las Injurias through a lane lit up by oil lamps and
skirting the Gas House.</p>

<p>Black and red smoke rose from the lofty chimneys.
The round paunches of the tanks were down
near the ground, and around them rose the girders,
which, in the darkness, produced an eerie effect.</p>

<p>La Blasa’s tavern was not open. Shivering with
the cold they proceeded along the Ronda. They
passed a factory whose windows filled the gloom of
the night with the violent brilliance of arc lights.</p>

<p>In the midst of this silence the factory seemed to
roar, belching clouds of smoke through the chimney.</p>

<p>“There shouldn’t be any factories,” burst out
Jesús with sudden indignation.</p>

<p>“And why not?” asked Don Alonso.</p>

<p>“Because there shouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“And how are people going to live? What’s
going to become of business if there aren’t any
factories?”</p>

<p>“Let it suffer, as we’re suffering. The earth
ought to provide enough for all of us to live on,”
added Jesús.</p>

<p>“And how about civilization?”</p>

<p>“Civilization! Much good civilization does us.
Civilization is all very good for the rich. But what
does it mean to the poor?...”</p>

<p>“And electric light? And steamships? And the
telegraph?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what about them? Do you use them?”</p>

<p>“No. But I <em>have</em> used them.”</p>

<p>“When you had money. Civilization is made for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the fellow with money, and whoever hasn’t the hard
cash,—let him starve. Formerly, the rich man and
the poor got their light alike from the same sort of
lamp; today the poor man continues with his humble
lamp and the rich man lights his house with electricity;
before, if the poor man went on foot, the rich
man went on horseback; today the poor man continues
to go on foot, and the rich man rides in an
automobile; before, the rich man had to dwell among
the poor; today, he lives apart; he’s raised a wall of
cotton and can hear nothing. Let the poor howl; he
can’t hear. Let them die of hunger; he’ll never
learn of it....</p>

<p>“You’re wrong,” protested Don Alonso.</p>

<p>“Hardly....”</p>

<p>The distant barking of the dogs could still be
heard. It was getting colder with every moment.
They walked through the Rondas of Valencia and
Atocha.</p>

<p>The solemn mass of a General Hospital, its
windows illumined by pallid lights, rose before them.</p>

<p>“Inside there, at least, a fellow isn’t cold,”
murmured the Snake-Man in a jovial tone that
echoed like a painful plaint.</p>

<p>It was beginning to grow light; the grey mists
of morning were scattering. Over the road some
ox-carts came creaking. Far off the hens were
cackling....</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Municipal Dungeons—The Returned Soldier—The
Convent Soup</p>

</div>

<p>Several times Manuel, Jesús and Don
Alonso slept in churches. One night, after
the trio had retired in a chapel of San Sebastian,
crowded with benches, the sexton threw them
out and handed them over to a couple of officers.
Don Alonso tried to show the guards that he was
not only a respectable person, but an important one
as well. While he was thus engaged in argument,
Jesús escaped by the Plaza de Santa Ana.</p>

<p>“You can tell all that to the court,” answered the
guard to the Snake-Man’s protestations.</p>

<p>They made their way through a nearby street and
entered by a gate before which burned a red lamp.
They climbed a narrow stairway into a room where
two clerks sat scribbling. The clerks ordered Don
Alonso and Manuel to be seated upon a bench,
which both made haste to do most humbly.</p>

<p>“You, the older, what’s your name?” asked one
of the clerks.</p>

<p>“I?” said the Snake-Man.</p>

<p>“Yes, you. Are you deaf, or an idiot?”</p>

<p>“No. No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you look it. What’s your name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alonso de Guzmán Calderón y Téllez.”</p>

<p>“Age?”</p>

<p>“Fifty-six.”</p>

<p>“Married or single?”</p>

<p>“Bachelor.”</p>

<p>“Profession?”</p>

<p>“Circus artist.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Up to a few days ago....”</p>

<p>“Where do you live now, I’m asking you, you imbecile.”</p>

<p>“Why, at present....”</p>

<p>“Write ‘without fixed residence,’” suggested the
other clerk.</p>

<p>They then registered Manuel, whereupon he and
the older man returned to their benches without a
word, deeply speculative upon the fate that awaited
them.</p>

<p>Officials of the department strolled around the
room, chatting; now and then would be heard the
tinkling of a bell.</p>

<p>Soon the door opened and a young woman came
in with a mantilla over her shoulders. Her eyes
were filled with great agitation.</p>

<p>She went over to the two clerks.</p>

<p>“Can you send somebody over ... to my house....
A physician ...? My mother just fell and
broke her head.”</p>

<p>The clerk blew out a puff from his cigar and made
no reply. Then, turning about so as to face the
woman, and staring at her from crown to toe, he
answered with an epical coarseness and bestiality:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“That belongs to the Emergency Hospital.
We’ve got nothing to do with such cases.” He
turned away and continued to smoke. The woman’s
eyes roved in fright through the room; she finally
decided to leave, mumbled good night in a breathless
voice to which nobody replied, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“The ink-spilling pettifoggers! The beasts!”
muttered Don Alonso in a low voice. “How much
would it have cost them to send some guard to accompany
that woman to the Emergency Hospital!”</p>

<p>Manuel and the Snake-Man spent more than two
hours on the bench. At the end of this time the
guards escorted them to another room in which was
a tall man with a black beard combed in <i>chulo</i>
fashion; he looked like a gambler or a <i>croupier</i>.</p>

<p>“Who are these persons?” asked the man, in an
Andalusian accent.... As he twirled his moustaches,
a diamond ring on his finger shot dazzling
gleams.</p>

<p>“They’re the fellows who’ve been sleeping in the
San Sebastian church,” said the guard. “They
haven’t any home.”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon,” interrupted Don Alonso.
“By sheer accident....”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll give them a home for a fortnight,”
said the tall man.</p>

<p>Before Don Alonso could utter a word one of the
guards shoved him rudely out of the room. Manuel
followed him.</p>

<p>The two guards made them descend the stairways
and put them into a dark room where, after some
groping, they located a bench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, better times are coming,” said Don
Alonso, sitting down and heaving a deep sigh.</p>

<p>Manuel, despite the fact that the situation was
by no means a comical one, was seized with such an
impulse to laugh that he could not contain it.</p>

<p>“What are you laughing at, sonny?” asked Don
Alonso.</p>

<p>Manuel could not explain the reason for his
laughter; but after a long siege of this hilarity he
was left in a funereal mood.</p>

<p>“What would Jesús say if he were here!” muttered
Manuel. “In the house of God, where all are
equal, it is a crime to enter and rest. The sexton
hands a fellow over to the guards; the guards
thrust a fellow into a dark cell. And who’s to know
what they’re going to do to us! I’m afraid they’ll
take us off to prison, if, for that matter, they don’t
hang us altogether.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense. If they’d only give us a
bite to eat!” moaned Don Alonso.</p>

<p>“They must be considering that.”</p>

<p>It must have been about one or two in the morning
when the door to this pig-pen was opened. The
Snake-Man and Manuel were led by two guards into
the street.</p>

<p>“Say, where are you taking us?” inquired Don
Alonso, a little scared.</p>

<p>“Keep on moving ahead,” replied the guard.</p>

<p>“This is an outrage,” muttered Don Alonso.</p>

<p>“You walk ahead, unless you want to march tied
elbow to elbow,” snarled the guard.</p>

<p>They crossed the Puerta del Sol, continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
through the Calle Mayor and stopped before the
Municipal Police Headquarters. To the left of the
causeway, by a narrow stairway, they had to descend
to a room with a low ceiling which was lighted by
an oil lamp. There were a number of high cots
where ten or a dozen guards were asleep in a row,
with their clothes and shoes on.</p>

<p>From this room they descended another tiny stairway
to a very narrow corridor, one of the sides of
which was divided into two cages with huge gratings.
Into one of these they thrust Don Alonso and
Manuel, locking the gate after them.</p>

<p>A man and a knot of gamins surrounded them
curiously.</p>

<p>“This is an outrage,” shouted Don Alonso.
“We’ve done nothing that gives them a right to imprison
us.”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” grumbled a young beggar who,
according to report, had been caught asking an
alms. “Besides, it’s impossible to stay here.”</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“One of these fellows has made a mess. He’s
sick and naked. They ought to take him to the
hospital. He says they’ve robbed him of his
clothes. The kids, though, say he gambled them
away in the cell.”</p>

<p>“And so he did,” declared one of the ragamuffins.
“We were sent up for two weeks. When we left
prison, just as we had reached the gate, they grabbed
us all again and brought us here.”</p>

<p>By the light from the corridor could be made out,
in the rear of that cage, several men on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Thrown upon a bench near the wall, naked, his
legs curled up to his belly, the sick man was huddled
into a threadbare cape; every move of his laid bare
some part of his person.</p>

<p>“Water!” he begged, in a thin voice.</p>

<p>“We’ve already asked the sergeant for some,”
said the beggar. “But he doesn’t bring it.”</p>

<p>“This is savagery!” roared the Snake-Man.
“This is barbaric.”</p>

<p>As no one paid any attention to Don Alonso, he
decided to subside into silence.</p>

<p>“That guy over there,” added the ragamuffin
with a laugh, “has syphilis and the mange.”</p>

<p>Don Alonso sank deeper than ever into his melancholy
and uttered not a word.</p>

<p>“And what are they going to do with us?” asked
Manuel.</p>

<p>“They’ll shoot us off to prison for a couple of
weeks,” answered the beggar.</p>

<p>“Do they eat there?” asked the Snake-Man,
rising from the depths of his self-absorption.</p>

<p>“Not always.”</p>

<p>There was a general silence. All at once there
was a hubbub of voices in the passageway; soon it
became a pandemonium of women’s shrieks, curses
and weeping.</p>

<p>“Hey, there, quit your shoving!”</p>

<p>“Damn the cuss!”</p>

<p>“Get along with you, now. Get along,” ordered
a man’s voice.</p>

<p>This was a rout of some thirty women who had
been arrested on the streets. They were all locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
up in the cage next to the men. Some were shouting,
others were groaning, and still others brought
forth their choicest repertory of abuse, which they
hurled at the heads of the Police Captain and the
Chief of the Board of Health.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a sound one among them,” observed
Don Alonso.</p>

<p>It seemed to Manuel that he made out the voices
of La Chata and La Rabanitos. After locking up
the women a sergeant came over to the men’s cage.</p>

<p>“Señor Sergeant,” spoke up Don Alonso.
“There’s a fellow here who’s sick.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“Señor Sergeant, perhaps you could do me a
favour ...” added Manuel.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“If there’s any reporter around for police news,
just tell him that I’m a compositor on <i>El Mundo</i> and
that I’ve been arrested.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll do so.”</p>

<p>Before a half hour had gone by the sergeant returned.
He opened the gate and turned toward
Manuel.</p>

<p>“Hey, you. Compositor. Out with you.”</p>

<p>Manuel stepped out, passed by the cage that
held the women, saw La Chata and La Rabanitos
in a knot of old prostitutes which contained a
negress (all of them horrible), and hurriedly
climbed the stairway to the room in which the reserve
guards were sleeping. The sergeant opened
the door, seized Manuel by the arm, gave him a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
kick with all his might and pushed him into the
street.</p>

<p>The City Hall clock was at three; it was
drizzling; Manuel went off by the Calle de Ciudad
Rodrigo to take shelter in the arches of the Plaza
Mayor, and as he was weary, he sat down upon a
door step. He was about to doze off when a man
who looked like a professional beggar took a seat
beside him. The fellow said he was a soldier back
from Cuba,—that he could find no employment and,
as far as that was concerned, was no good for work
any more, as he had got used to living in constant
flight.</p>

<p>“After all,” continued the returned soldier, “I’ve
got my luck with me. If I haven’t died this winter,
I’ll never die.”</p>

<p>The two spent the night huddled close to one another,
and the next morning went to the Plaza de la
Cebada on a foraging expedition. The soldier
pilfered some nuts from a pile, and this constituted
the breakfast of the two comrades.</p>

<p>Later they went down by the Toledo bridge.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Here, to a Trappist monastery near Getafe.
They’ll give us a feed,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>Manuel quickened his pace.</p>

<p>“Let’s hurry.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need. They bring out the food
after they themselves have eaten. So that even if
you run, you don’t gain anything by it. We must
take our time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel moderated his gait. The soldier was a
common sort; his nose was thick, his face wide, his
moustaches blond. He wore a pointed hat, clothes
covered with patches, an old muffler rolled around
his throat, and in his hand, a stick.</p>

<p>They reached the monastery, walked into the
porter’s lodge and sat down before a table where
six or seven men were already waiting.</p>

<p>“Can you write verses?” asked the soldier of
Manuel.</p>

<p>“I? No. Why?”</p>

<p>“Because a few days ago I came here with a
gentleman who was really as dead hungry as ourselves.
While we were waiting for the meal he
asked the name of the rector and wrote some verses
to him that were as pretty as you’d wish. Then the
rector sent for him and gave him plenty to eat and
drink.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame that we can’t write a rhyme.
What’s the rector’s name?”</p>

<p>“Domingo.”</p>

<p>Manuel tried hard to find a word ending in <i>ingo</i>,
but could not. And when the lay brother entered
with a large pot that he deposited upon the table,
Manuel forgot his task completely.</p>

<p>The brother then brought wooden spoons and
distributed them among the beggars. Of these,
all but one brought forth large cups; the solitary exception
was a repulsive type with a swollen lower lip
that protruded and was covered with ulcers.</p>

<p>“Wait a second, brother,” said the soldier, before
the other fellow could thrust his spoon into the pot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
“We’re going to put the food into the cover of the
pot and we’ll eat from there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’ve got against me!”
mumbled the beggar.</p>

<p>“You? You’ve got a lip that looks like a beefsteak.”</p>

<p>Manuel and the soldier then ate and after thanking
the lay brother they left the monastery and
stretched themselves out on the field in the sun.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful May afternoon; the sun shone
strong and steady. The returned soldier recounted
some anecdotes of the campaign in Cuba. He spoke
in a violent fashion, and when anger or indignation
mastered him, he grew terribly pale.</p>

<p>He talked of life on that island,—a horrible life;
forever marching and marching, barefoot, legs sunk
into swampy soil and the air clouded with mosquitos
whose bites left welts on your skin. He recalled a
dingy little village theatre that had been converted
into a hospital, its stage cluttered with sick and
wounded. The army officers, even before the fantastic
battles—for the Cubans always ran off like
hares—would dispute the distribution of crosses,
and the soldiers would make fun of the battles and
the crosses and the bravery of their leaders. Then
the war of extermination decreed by Weyler, the
burning mills, the green slopes that in a moment
were left without a bush, the exploding cane, and, in
the towns, the famished populace, the women and
children crying: “Don Lieutenant, Don Sergeant,
we’re hungry!” Besides this, the executions, the
cold slaughter of one by the other with the machetes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Between generals and lower officers, hatred and
rivalry; and in the meantime the soldiers, indifferent
to it all, hardly replying to the sharpshooting of
the enemy, with the same affection for life that one
can feel for a discarded sandal. There were some
who said: “Captain, I’ll remain here.” Whereupon
their guns were taken from them and the others
proceeded. And after all this, their return to
Spain, almost sadder than the life in Cuba; the
whole ship loaded with men dressed in striped cotton
duck; a ship laden with skeletons, and every day five,
six or seven who died and were cast into the waves.</p>

<p>“And the arrival at Barcelona! Hell! What a
disillusion!” he concluded. “A fellow would be
waiting for some sort of reward for having served
his country,—hoping for a little affection. Eh?
Not a thing. Lord! Everybody looked at you as
you went by without paying the slightest attention.
We disembark in port as if we’re so many bales of
cotton. On the ship we had said to ourselves,
‘We’ll be swamped with questions when we get back
to Spain.’ Nothing like it. Nobody was in the least
interested in what I had gone through in the Cuban
thickets.... Go and defend your country, ha?
Let the papal Nuncio go and defend it! So that
he can afterward die of hunger and cold, and have
somebody say to him: ‘If you had any guts, the
island wouldn’t have been lost.’ It’s too damned
much, I say! Too much!...”</p>

<p>The sun was already sinking in the west when the
soldier and Manuel got up and went off toward
Madrid.</p>

<h3 id="II_CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Night in the Paseo de la Virgen del Puerto—A Shot
Rings Out—Calatrava and Vidal—A Tango by La Bella
Pérez</p>

</div>

<p>“On nights when it isn’t very cold,” said the
soldier, “I sleep in that grove near the
Virgen del Puerto. Would you want to
go there today?” he added.</p>

<p>“Sure. Come on.”</p>

<p>They were at the Puerta del Sol, so they went
down the Calle Mayor. It was a rather misty
night; the mist was bluish, luminous, and tempered
the wind; the electric globes of the Royal Palace
shone in this floating haze with a livid light.</p>

<p>Manuel and the soldier descended the Cuesta de
la Vega and entered a little wood that runs between
the Campo del Moro and the Calle de Segovia.
Here and there an oil lantern shed its pallid glow
among the trees. They reached the Paseo de los
Melancólicos. Near the Segovia bridge flames were
leaping from the furnaces of a grease factory that
had been installed in a hut. From the Paseo de los
Melancólicos they descended into the hollow, where
they took refuge in a shed and prepared to go to
sleep. It was cool; several mysterious couples were
moving around in the vicinity; Manuel curled up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
thrust his hands into his trousers pockets and was
soon sound asleep.</p>

<p class="tb">The shrill blare of bugles awoke him.</p>

<p>“That’s the Palace Guard,” said the soldier.</p>

<p>The pale glow of dawn flushed the sky; soft and
grey quivered the first light of day.... Suddenly,
from very near, came the discharge of firearms;
Manuel and the soldier jumped to their feet;
they rushed out of the shed ready for flight. But
they saw nothing.</p>

<p>“A young chap has just committed suicide,” cried
a man in a smock as he ran by Manuel and the soldier.</p>

<p>They approached the place whence the sound of
the shot had come and beheld a young man, well
dressed, lying on the ground, his face covered with
blood, a revolver clutched in his right hand. There
was nobody in the vicinity. The soldier drew near
to the corpse, lifted the youth’s right hand and removed
two rings, one of them with a diamond.
Then he opened the dead man’s coat, went through
the pockets, found no money and fished out a gold
watch.</p>

<p>“Let’s be off before anybody shows up,” said
Manuel.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the soldier.</p>

<p>He returned to the shed where they had passed
the night, dug a hole into the ground with his fingernails,
wrapped the rings and the watch in a sheet of
paper, buried them, and stamped down the earth
with his foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“In war times, war methods,” murmured the soldier,
after having executed this manœuvre with extraordinary
rapidity. “Now,” he added, “lie down
and pretend to be fast asleep, in case anybody should
happen along.”</p>

<p>In a few moments came a drone of voices from
the hollow, and Manuel saw two guards pass by
the shed on horseback.</p>

<p>People were hastening toward the scene of the
suicide. The civil guards, after a search of the
corpse, found a letter addressed to the judge in
which the deceased declared that nobody was responsible
for his death.</p>

<p>Manuel and the soldier joined the curious onlookers.</p>

<p>When they picked up the body and bore it off,
Manuel asked:</p>

<p>“Shall we go back and dig the stuff up?”</p>

<p>“Wait for everybody to disappear.”</p>

<p>The place was soon deserted. The soldier then
disinterred the rings and the watch.</p>

<p>“I think this diamond ring is all right,” he said.
“How are we to find out?”</p>

<p>“At a jeweller’s.”</p>

<p>“If you were to go to a jeweller’s in those rags
of yours, with a diamond ring and a gold watch,
it’s very likely that you’d be reported and taken off
to prison.”</p>

<p>“Then what are we going to do? Could we pawn
the watch?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“That’s dangerous, too. Let’s go and hunt up
Marcos Calatrava, a friend of mine whom I got to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
know in Cuba. He’ll get us out of the fix. He
lives in a boarding-house on the Calle de Embajadores.”</p>

<p>Thither they went. A woman came to the door
and informed them that this Marcos had moved.
The soldier made inquiries in a tavern on the ground
floor of the house.</p>

<p>“Old Cripple! Sure I know him. I should
say!” declared the tavern-keeper. “Do you know
where he hangs around nights? In the Majo de
las Cubas tavern, over on the Calle Mayor.”</p>

<p>To Manuel and the soldier this was one of the
longest days in their lives. They were frightfully
hungry and the thought that the sale of these rings
and the watch could provide them with all they
wanted to eat, and that fear kept them from satisfying
this imperative need, drove them to distraction.
They dragged themselves wearily through
the streets, returning from time to time to inquire
whether the cripple had yet arrived.</p>

<p>Toward evening they caught sight of him. The
soldier walked over to him, saluted, and the three
passed to the back of the tavern to talk things over
in a corner.</p>

<p>“I’m expecting my secretary any moment,” said
Marcos, “and he’ll arrange matters. In the meantime,
order supper yourselves.”</p>

<p>“You do the ordering,” said the soldier to
Manuel.</p>

<p>Manuel did so, and to add to the delay, the waiter
said that the supper would be some time in coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>While the soldier conversed with Calatrava,
Manuel observed the latter closely.</p>

<p>Calatrava was a rare specimen, appearing at first
sight almost ludicrous; he had a wooden leg, a very
narrow face, as dry and black as a smoked fish; two
or three scars graced his forehead; his moustaches
were stiff and his hair kinky. He wore a bright-coloured
suit with very wide trousers and reeled along
on his natural leg as well as on his artificial; his
jacket was short, somewhat darker than his trousers;
his cravat was of red and his straw hat tiny.</p>

<p>In a beery voice Marcos ordered a few glasses.
They drank them down, and soon a dandy came in,
wearing yellow shoes, a derby and a silk handkerchief
around his neck.</p>

<p>At sight of him, Manuel cried out:</p>

<p>“Vidal! Is that you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy. What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Do you know this young man?” asked Calatrava
of Vidal.</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s a cousin of mine.”</p>

<p>Marcos explained to Vidal what the soldier
wished.</p>

<p>“This very instant,” answered Vidal. “It won’t
take me ten minutes.”</p>

<p>And indeed, within a short time he returned with
two pawn-tickets and several notes. The soldier
took them and divided them; Manuel’s share was
five duros.</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” said Calatrava to Vidal. “You
and your cousin stay here and have supper; you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
have plenty to talk about. We’ll go off to somewhere
else, for we’ve a few things to discuss ourselves.
Take your cousin to your house for the
night.”</p>

<p>They left, and Manuel and Vidal remained alone.</p>

<p>“Have you had supper?” asked Vidal.</p>

<p>“No. But I’ve already ordered it. And your
parents?”</p>

<p>“They must be all right.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see them?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“And El Bizco?”</p>

<p>Vidal turned ashen white.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention El Bizco to me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“No, no. I’m horribly afraid of him. Don’t
you know what happened?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Dolores La Escandalosa was killed.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know a thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The old woman was slain in a house
called The Confessional, over toward Aravaca.
And do you know who murdered her?”</p>

<p>“El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m sure of that. El Bizco used to go to
The Confessional to meet a gang of tramps like
himself.”</p>

<p>“That’s true. He told me so.”</p>

<p>“Have you spoken to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But that was a long time ago.”</p>

<p>“Well, the newspapers that reported the crime
say that the murderer must have been of extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
strength, and that the woman must have gone
there as if to a rendezvous. It was El Bizco, I’m
certain.”</p>

<p>“And haven’t they caught him?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Vidal was immersed in thought; it could be seen
that he was making every effort to control himself.
The waiter brought supper. Manuel attacked the
meal voraciously.</p>

<p>“Boy, what a small appetite you have!” commented
Vidal smiling, his calm having returned.</p>

<p>“Lord! I was as hungry....”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out and have a coffee now.”</p>

<p>Vidal paid the bill, they left the tavern and went
into the Café de Lisboa.</p>

<p>While they were sipping their coffee, Manuel
scrutinized Vidal. The youth’s hair was very lustrous;
it was parted in the middle and curly tufts
fell over his ears. His movements betrayed a vast
aplomb; his smile was that of a self-consciously
handsome man; his neck was round, without any
salient muscles. He spoke with a sympathetic ring
in his voice, always smiling; but his shrewd, treacherous
eyes betrayed the falsity of his speech;
their expression did not harmonize with the affability
of his affectionate word and his ingratiating
smile. One read in them only distrust and
caution.</p>

<p>“And you,—what are you doing?” asked Manuel,
after having examined him carefully.</p>

<p>“Pse!... I manage to exist....”</p>

<p>“But on what? How?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are certain deals, my boy.... Then,
women....”</p>

<p>“But do you work?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon what you call work.”</p>

<p>“Man! I mean, do you go to a shop....”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Have you a sweetheart?”</p>

<p>“At present I have only three.”</p>

<p>“Christ! What luck! Where do you find
them?”</p>

<p>“Around here. In the theatres, at dances....
I’m secretary of the Bisturi, and member of the
Paloma Azul and the Billete.”</p>

<p>“And through them you manage to get acquainted
with plenty of women?”</p>

<p>“Of course! And then, as far as women are concerned,
it’s all a matter of gab.... Sometimes
you’ve got to show them that you’re sore, and let
’em feel your fist....”</p>

<p>“You sure live the life!... If I could only do
the same!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s as easy as pie!... I’ve got a peach
of a kid now,—the prettiest skirt in the world and
just crazy over me. She gave me this watch chain....
But the best of all is that there’s a certain
party hanging around me, pestering me, and I’ll bet
you could not guess who.”</p>

<p>“How could I know? Some marchioness,
maybe.”</p>

<p>“No. A marquis.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing. He’s courting me.”</p>

<p>Manuel stared in astonishment at Vidal, who
smiled mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Are you tired?” asked Vidal.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go to the Romea.”</p>

<p>“What have they got over there?”</p>

<p>“Dancing and pretty women.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>They left the Café and went up the Calle de Carretas.</p>

<p>Vidal bought two orchestra chairs. It was Sunday.</p>

<p>The air inside the theatre was dense, hot, saturated
with smoke and with the respiration of hundreds
of persons who during the entire afternoon
and evening had piled into the place. There was
a full house. The piece was as stupid as could be,
infested with silly, coarse jests delivered in the most
insipid manner imaginable, amidst the interruptions
and the shouts of the public. The curtain descended
and immediately there appeared a girl who
sang, in a shrill voice that went horribly off key, a
pornographic ditty without an atom of wit. Then
out came a painted, ugly old hulk of a Frenchwoman
in a huge hat. She advanced close to the footlights
and intoned an almost endless ballad of which
Manuel understood not half a word, with the refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Pauvre petit chat, petit chat</i>,</div>
<div class="verse">Poor little kitty, little kitty.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she executed a few turns, kicking one of her
legs till it touched her hat, and disappeared. The
curtain again descended; a moment later it rose, revealing
La Bella Pérez, who was greeted with a
round salvo of applause. She sang a popular song
very badly, smiling through several errors, and retreating
to the wings after the number. The piano
of the orchestra then spiritedly attacked a tango,
and La Bella Pérez issued from the wings in a ballet
skirt, a toreador’s cape around her shoulders, a Cordovan
hat thrust down over her eyes, and a cigar between
her lips. After the piano had concluded these
introductory measures, she threw the cigar into the
pit for the orchestra patrons to snatch at, removed
her cape, and remained with her skirt tightly
gathered back by her hands, thus revealing in sharp
outline her stomach and her thighs. At the very
first notes of the tango a religious hush fell upon the
assemblage; a breath of voluptuousness stirred
through the auditorium. Every face was aglow,
every glance fixed glitteringly upon the stage. And
the belle went through her dance with a frowning
face and teeth tightly clenched, stamping her heels,
causing her powerful hips to stand out when she
would fold her skirts about her like a victorious
banner. From this beautiful feminine body issued
a stream of sex that maddened every spectator. At
the end of the dance she placed the hat upon her
stomach and gave her hips a wiggle that brought a
roar of lust from the entire audience.</p>

<p>“That’s the girlie!”</p>

<p>“There’s what you call wiggling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a shape!”</p>

<p>The dance came to an end upon a volley of applause.</p>

<p>“Tango! Tango!” shrieked the spectators as if
possessed.</p>

<p>Manuel, his eyes moist with enthusiasm, was
shouting and clapping his hands wildly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for lust!” bellowed a youth at Manuel’s
side.</p>

<p>La Bella Pérez repeated the tango. Behind
Manuel and Vidal was a girl rocking a child in her
arms; the tot’s face was covered with scabs. The
girl, pointing to La Bella Pérez, crooned to the
child:</p>

<p>“See. See mamma.”</p>

<p>“Is she the mother of this little girl?” asked
Manuel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the nurse.</p>

<p>Without knowing why, Manuel suddenly lost all
enthusiasm for the dance, and even imagined that
behind the coat of paint and the rice powder that
covered the dancer’s face, lay a mass of rash and
pimples.</p>

<p>Manuel and his cousin left the theatre. Vidal
boarded at a house on the Calle del Olmo.</p>

<p>They walked off through the Calle de Atocha
and at the corner of the Calle de la Magdalena they
encountered La Chata and La Rabanitos, who recognized
them and called to them.</p>

<p>The two girls were waiting for La Engracia, who
had gone off with a man. In the meantime they
were quarreling. La Rabanitos was swearing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
most solemn oaths that she was no more than sixteen
years old; La Chata asserted that she was
going on eighteen.</p>

<p>“Why, I heard your own mother say so!” she
shouted.</p>

<p>“But why should my mother say any such thing?
You sow!” retorted La Rabanitos.</p>

<p>“But she did say so, you cheap bitch!”</p>

<p>“When did I go into the business? Three years
ago. And how old was I then? Thirteen.”</p>

<p>“Bah! You were on the streets ten years ago,”
interrupted Vidal.</p>

<p>The girl whirled about like a snake, eyed Vidal
from top to bottom and then, in a rasping voice,
snapped:</p>

<p>“As for you, you’re of the sort that takes a front
seat and lets your friends go hang.”</p>

<p>The hearers greeted this circumlocution with applause,
for it revealed La Rabanitos’s imaginative
qualities. Thus calmed, she drew from her apron
pocket her wrinkled, grimy certificate, and passed it
around.</p>

<p>La Engracia came upon them while they were
busied with the task of deciphering the certificate.</p>

<p>“What do you say? You treat,” suggested Vidal
to her. “Have you got any money?”</p>

<p>“Money! Yes! The housekeepers ask more
and more. I don’t know where they’ll stop at.”</p>

<p>“Come on. If only for a little nip.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Come along.”</p>

<p>The five of them trooped into a bun shop.</p>

<p>“This gentleman I was with,” said La Engracia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
“is a painter, and he told me that he’d give me five
pesetas per hour for posing as a model in the nude.”</p>

<p>La Rabanitos was scandalized at the news.</p>

<p>“What good are you going to be as a nude model
when you haven’t any tits?” she shrilled, in her high
voice.</p>

<p>“Naw! I suppose you’ve got them!”</p>

<p>“When it comes to that, I may not have any
special reason for getting a swelled head,” sneered
La Rabanitos. “But I’ve got a better figure than
you.”</p>

<p>“Hell you have!” retorted the other, and affecting
to pay no attention, she turned to chat with
Vidal. La Rabanitos then took possession of
Manuel and recounted her troubles with all the
seriousness of an old woman.</p>

<p>“Boy, I’m all in,” she confessed. “Naturally
weak.... And then men are so brutal....
When they find a girl like that, they do as they
please, of course, and everybody steps all over you.”</p>

<p>Manuel heard what La Rabanitos was saying; but
exhaustion and drowsiness precluded him from understanding.
Two other girls entered the shop with
a couple of vagabonds; one of the young men had a
pudgy face, clouded eyes and an expression compounded
of ferocity and cynicism. All four were
drunk. The women began to insult everybody in
the place.</p>

<p>“Who are those women?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“A couple of scandalous dames.”</p>

<p>“See here, let’s be going,” suggested Vidal to his
cousin, with the prudence that characterized him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>They left the bun shop; the girls went off toward
the heart of the city while Manuel and Vidal walked
through the Calle de Ave María as far as the Calle
del Olmo. Vidal opened the gate to his house.</p>

<p>“Here’s the place,” he said to Manuel.</p>

<p>They climbed to the top floor. There Vidal
struck a match, thrust his hand underneath the door,
drew forth a key and opened. They crossed a passageway,
and Vidal said to Manuel:</p>

<p>“This is your room. See you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Manuel took off his rags, and the bed seemed so
soft to him that despite his weariness it was a long
time before he fell asleep.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>Can Better Times Have Come at Last?—Vidal’s Proposals</p>

</div>

<p>When Manuel awoke next morning it was
already twelve. For so long his first
sensations, upon awakening, had been of
cold, hunger or anguish, that now, finding himself
under a blanket, sheltered, in a narrow room with
little light in it, he wondered whether he were
dreaming.</p>

<p>Then all at once the suicide at the Virgen del
Puerto came to his mind; there followed his encounter
with Vidal, the dance at the Romea and the
conversation with La Rabanitos in the bun shop.</p>

<p>“Can better times have come at last?” he asked
himself. He sat up in bed, and catching sight of his
rags strewn across a chair, was at a loss. “If they
find me dressed like this, they’ll throw me out,” he
thought. And in his hesitancy he slipped back under
the sheets.</p>

<p>It must have been almost two when he heard the
door to his room being opened. It was Vidal.</p>

<p>“Why, man! Do you know what time it is?
Why don’t you get up?”</p>

<p>“If they see me with those things on,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Manuel, pointing to his shreds and patches, “they’ll
throw me out.”</p>

<p>“The truth is that you can’t very well dress in the
height of fashion,” commented Vidal, contemplating
his cousin’s wardrobe. “A fine pair of dancing slippers,”
he added, lifting up a misshapen, mud-caked
boot by the laces and holding it comically aloft the
better to observe it. “The latest style worn by
sewer-men. As to socks, none; drawers, the same,
of the same cloth as the socks. You’re splendidly
outfitted!”</p>

<p>“As you see.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t stay here for ever. You’ve got to
get out. I’ll fetch you some of my own clothes. I
think they’ll fit you.”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’re a bit taller.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Vidal left the room and soon returned with some
of his own clothes. Manuel dressed hastily. The
trousers were somewhat too long for him and had to
be rolled up at the bottom; on the other hand, the
shoes were not high enough, and were tight.</p>

<p>“You have a small foot,” murmured Manuel.
“You were born to be a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Vidal thereupon thrust forward his well-shod foot
with a certain feminine pride.</p>

<p>“Some young women would give a great deal to
have a pair of <i>pinreles</i><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> like these, wouldn’t they?
I don’t like a woman with big feet. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I? My boy, I like them all sizes, even the old
ones. There’s so little to choose from.... Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
me a newspaper, will you. I want to wrap up these
precious garments of mine.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“So’s they won’t be discovered here. That spoils
a fellow’s name. I’ll throw them into the street.
Likely as not, the chap who picks them up will think
he’s come upon a windfall.”</p>

<p>Manuel wrapped up the rags with great care,
made a neat package, tied it with twine and took it
in his hand.</p>

<p>“Shall we start?”</p>

<p>“Come along.”</p>

<p>They went out. It seemed to Manuel that everybody’s
gaze was fixed upon him and upon the package
that he was carrying. He did not dare to leave
it anywhere.</p>

<p>“Get rid of it. Don’t be a simpleton,” said
Vidal, and snatching the bundle from Manuel’s hand
he threw it over a wall into a lot.</p>

<p>The two youths walked through the Calle de la
Magdalena to the Plaza de Anton Martín and went
into the Café de Zaragoza.</p>

<p>They took seats. Vidal ordered two coffees and
toast.</p>

<p>“How self-possessed he is,” thought Manuel.</p>

<p>The waiter returned with the order and Manuel
threw himself ravenously upon one of the slices.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Vidal, gazing at him
from time to time. “What a vagabond’s face you
have!”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“How do I know? Because you have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s a fellow going to do about it? He looks
like what he is.”</p>

<p>“But have you been working? Have you learned
a trade?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve been a servant, a baker, a ragpicker,
a typesetter, and now a tramp. And of all these
things, I can’t say which is the worst.”</p>

<p>“You must have gone hungry many a time, eh?”</p>

<p>“Uf!... Plenty.... If only they were the
last times!”</p>

<p>“They surely will be, man. They will, if you
really want them to be.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? By going to work again?”</p>

<p>“Or some other way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know any other way of making a
living, boy. Either work or steal; either be wealthy
or beg alms. I’ve lost the habit of working; I
haven’t the nerve to rob. I’m not rich; so I’ll have
to go out begging. Unless I enlist in the army one
of these days.”</p>

<p>“All this chatter of yours,” replied Vidal, “is pure
rot. Can anybody say that I work? No. That I
rob or beg alms? Not that, either. That I’m
rich? Hardly.... Yet you see, I get along.”</p>

<p>“You sure do. You must have some secret.”</p>

<p>“Maybe.”</p>

<p>“And might a fellow know what that secret is?”</p>

<p>“If you knew it, would you tell me?”</p>

<p>“Why, man ... you’ll see. If I had a secret
and you wanted to rob it from me, to tell the truth
I’d keep it to myself. But if you didn’t mean to
steal it from me altogether, but simply to use it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
your own livelihood and not prevent me from using
it, too, then I’d certainly let you know what it was.”</p>

<p>“Right you are. You’re frank enough....
What the devil! See here, I’d do anything for you,
and I don’t mind letting you in on how we fellows
live. You’re a queer, good-natured duck. You’re
not one of those brutes who think of nothing but
murdering and assassinating folks. I’ll tell you
openly—why shouldn’t I?—I’m not much of a
hero....”</p>

<p>“Nor I!” exclaimed Manuel.</p>

<p>“Bah! You’re brave. Even El Bizco had respect
for you.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!”</p>

<p>“As you wish. But getting back to what we were
talking about: you and I,—especially me—were
born to be rich. But as cursed luck would have it,
we’re not. It’s impossible to make a fortune by
working, and nobody can tell me different. To
save up anything at all, you’ve got to poke yourself
into a corner and work away like a mule for thirty
years. And how much does a fellow manage to
get together? A few measly pesetas. Total:
nothin’. You can’t make money? Then you’ve
got to see to it that you take it from somebody else,
and take it without danger of doing time.”</p>

<p>“And how do you manage that?”</p>

<p>“That’s the question. There’s the rub. See
here: When I came to the heart of the city from
Casa Blanca, I was a petty-thief, a pickpocket. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
nothing at all they sent me up for two weeks to the
cage in El Abanico, and when I think of it, kid, I
get goose-flesh. I was more afraid than ashamed
of being a robber, that’s a fact; but what was I to
do? One day, when I stole some electric bulbs from
a house on the Calle del Olivo, the janitress, an
ugly old hag, caught me in the act and began to run
after me, crying, ‘Stop thief! Stop thief!’ I grew
wings on my feet, as you may imagine. Reaching
the San Luis church I dropped the bulbs, slipped in
among the crowd in church and crouched into a pew;
they didn’t catch me. But ever since that day, boy,
I’ve been scared out of my wits. Yet, as you see,
despite my fright, I haven’t changed my ways.”</p>

<p>“Did you go back to stealing bulbs?”</p>

<p>“No, sirree. I stayed in the <i>Apolo</i> patio with
that flower-girl that La Rabanitos hated so much.
Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“I sure do.”</p>

<p>“There was an interesting girl for you. Well, I
was staying there when once I saw a fat guy in a
white waistcoat chatting with some skirts. There
were many people about; I side up to him, get a
hold of his watch chain, tug at it gently till I pull the
watch out of his pocket, then turn the ring so as to
loosen it. As the chain was rather heavy there was
the danger that, on separating it from the watch I’d
hit the gentleman in the belly and so let him see
that he’d been picked; but at this very moment there
was some applause, people began to shove into the
theatre; so I loosened the chain and made my escape.
I was making off opposite San José for the Calle de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
las Torres, when I felt a hand clutch mine. Boy,
didn’t I break into a sweat ...! ‘Let me go!’ I
said.—‘Shut up, or I’ll call a cop!’ says the other
guy. (And I shut up.) ‘I saw you lift that duffer’s
watch,’ he says. ‘I?’—‘Yes, you. You’ve got the
watch in your trousers pocket. So don’t be foolish
and come on have a drink on me in the Brígido
tavern.’—‘Come on,’ says I to myself. ‘This is a
clever guy who must be in the game.’ We went into
the tavern and there the fellow spoke straight from
the shoulder. ‘See here,’ he says to me. ‘You
want to get on at any cost, don’t you? But you
hate the Abanico, and I can easily understand that,
for you’re no idiot. Very well, then; how do you
expect to get on? What weapons have you for
the struggle in life? You’re nothing but a fledgling;
you don’t know people; you don’t the world. You
come to my house tomorrow; I’ll take you to a shop
where they sell ready made clothes, you’ll buy a suit,
a hat, and a trunk, and I’ll recommend you to a good
boarding-house. I’ll see to it that you make plenty
of money, for you can just bet the softest snap in the
world is getting the dough where there’s plenty of it.
Now hand over that watch. They’d fool you.’”</p>

<p>“And did you hand it over to him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Next day....”</p>

<p>“You must have been left empty-handed....”</p>

<p>“The next day I was already making money.”</p>

<p>“And who’s this man?”</p>

<p>“Marcos Calatrava.”</p>

<p>“Old Cripple? The soldier’s friend?”</p>

<p>“That’s the guy. So now you know. What he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
said to me, I say to you. Do you want to join the
gang?”</p>

<p>“But what am I supposed to do?”</p>

<p>“That depends on the business in hand.... If
you accept, you’ll live an easy life, have a swell dame
... and there’ll be no danger.... It’s up to
you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say, boy. If it means
being up to rascality, I almost prefer living as I
am.”</p>

<p>“Man! That depends upon what you call
rascality. Do you call deceiving rascality? Then
you have to deceive. There’s no other way out.
Either work or trick people out of it, for as to being
presented with money, make up your mind they don’t
do such things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true enough.”</p>

<p>“Why, my boy, everything is trickery. Business
and robbery are the same thing. The only difference
is that in business you’re a respectable person,
while for robbery they take you to jail.”</p>

<p>“Do you really believe so ...?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do. What’s more, I believe that there
are only two kinds of men in the world: the first live
well and rob either labour or money; the second live
badly and are robbed.”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re talking sense, you are!”</p>

<p>“You bet.... It’s eat or be eaten. Well, what
do you say?”</p>

<p>“What should I say? I accept. Another
Society like the Three.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t make any comparisons. We don’t want
to recall the other one. There’s no Bizco in this
combination.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a Cripple.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but a Cripple who has guts.”</p>

<p>“Is he the chief of the party?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the truth, kid.... I don’t know.
I deal with the Cripple, the Cripple deals with the
Master, and the Master with Lord knows whom.
What I do know is that higher up, at the very top,
there are some big guns. Let me give you one word
of advice: see, hear, and keep your mouth shut. If
you ever get wind of anything, let me know; outside,
not a word. Understand?”</p>

<p>“I get you.”</p>

<p>“It’s all a matter of cleverness in this game,—keeping
your eyes open and not letting anybody put
anything over on you. If things go well, within a
few years we can be on Easy street, as respectable as
any one could wish.... A cinch....”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Manuel. “Have you come up yet
for military service? For I’ll be damned if I know
whether I have.”</p>

<p>“Sure. I was dismissed. You’d better see to
that. Otherwise they’ll seize you as a deserter.”</p>

<p>“Pse!”</p>

<p>“We’ll let Old Cripple know about it.”</p>

<p>“When shall we see him?”</p>

<p>“He ought to be here in a moment.”</p>

<p>And surely enough, shortly after, the Cripple
entered the café. Vidal, in a few words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
told him what he had proposed to his cousin.</p>

<p>“Will he do?” asked Calatrava, eyeing Manuel
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s cleverer than he looks,” answered
Vidal, laughing.</p>

<p>Manuel drew himself up proudly to his full
height.</p>

<p>“Very well; we’ll see. For the present he won’t
have very much to do,” answered the Cripple.</p>

<p>Thereupon Calatrava and Vidal entered upon a
discussion of their private affairs, while Manuel
passed the time with a newspaper.</p>

<p>After they had finished talking, Calatrava left the
café and the two cousins were once more alone.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the Círculo,” suggested Vidal.</p>

<p>The Círculo was on one of the central thoroughfares.
They went in; the ground floor contained a
billiard and pool room, and several restaurant tables.</p>

<p>Vidal took a seat at one of these, struck a bell,
and to the waiter who answered this summons, said:</p>

<p>“For two.”</p>

<p>“Right away.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” added Vidal, to Manuel: “From the
moment we get into here, not a word. Ask me
nothing; say nothing. Whatever you need to know,
I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>They ate; Vidal chattered about theatres, clubs,
things that Manuel had never heard about. He remained
silent.</p>

<p>“Let’s take coffee upstairs,” said Vidal.</p>

<p>Near the counter there was a door; from this rose
a very narrow winding stairway to the mezzanine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
The stairway led to a door of ground glass. Vidal
pushed it open and they walked into a corridor
flanked with green screens.</p>

<p>At the end of this passage, a man sat at a table,
writing. He looked up at Vidal and Manuel and
then resumed his work. Vidal opened another
door, drew aside a heavy curtain and made way for
them both.</p>

<p>They found themselves in a large room with three
little balconies that looked out upon the street and
three others giving upon the patio. On the side
toward the street stood a large green table, sunken in
at the two longer sides; near the patio was a smaller
table, illuminated by two lamps, around which were
crowded some thirty or forty persons. There was
a deep silence; nothing was heard save the voices of
the two <i>croupiers</i> and the sounds of their rakes
scraping in the money laid upon the green carpet.</p>

<p>After each play there would be a discussion among
the players. Then the monotonous voice of the
banker would say:</p>

<p>“<i>Faites vos jeux, messieurs.</i>”</p>

<p>The murmur of conversation would cease and the
silence would be so great that one might hear the
shuffling of the cards between the fingers of the
<i>croupier</i>.</p>

<p>“This looks like a church, doesn’t it?” whispered
Vidal. “As one of the gentlemen who comes here
says, gambling is the only religion that’s left.”</p>

<p>They had some coffee and a glass of whiskey.</p>

<p>“Have you any cigars?” asked Vidal.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have one. Watch this game closely. I’m
going.”</p>

<p>“Might a fellow know what it’s called?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Baccarat. Listen: at eight, in the Café
de Lisboa.”</p>

<p>Vidal went out and Manuel was left alone. He
watched the money pass to and fro between the bank
and the players, the players and the bank. Then he
amused himself by watching the gamblers. The
participants were so intent upon their game that no
one paid any attention to his neighbour.</p>

<p>Those who were seated had in front of them
heaps of silver and chips which they placed upon the
carpet. The <i>croupier</i> would lay out the French
cards and shortly afterward pay out or take in the
money thus placed.</p>

<p>Those who were standing around the table, the
majority of whom were not taking part in the game,
seemed as deeply interested as, if not more so than,
the persons seated and playing heavily.</p>

<p>They were specimens of poverty and horrible sordidness;
they wore threadbare coats, greasy hats,
baggy trousers spattered with mud.</p>

<p>Their eyes were aflame with the passion of the
game, and they followed the progress of the plays
with their arms clasped behind their backs and their
bodies bent forward, holding in their breath.</p>

<p>The scene finally bored Manuel. He gazed into
the street from the balconies. He watched players
leave and new ones take their places. Toward
nightfall he left for the Café de Lisboa.</p>

<p>Vidal arrived; they ate supper, and as they did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
so, Manuel expressed his doubts as to the game.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You’ll pick it up soon enough,”
assured Vidal. “Besides, the first few days I’ll give
you a little card with information as to when you’re
to play.”</p>

<p>“Fine. And the money?”</p>

<p>“Here’s enough for tomorrow. Fifty duros.”</p>

<p>“Is this good money?”</p>

<p>“Show it to anybody you please.”</p>

<p>“Then this is a scheme something like El
Pastiri’s?”</p>

<p>“The very thing.”</p>

<p>The following afternoon, with the fifty duros
that his cousin gave him and according to the instructions
written upon a card, he played and won
twenty duros, which he handed over to Vidal.</p>

<p>A few days later he was summoned to a barracks,
sent to an office, where his name was asked, and
then was told to go.</p>

<p>“You’ve been dismissed,” said Vidal.</p>

<p>“Good,” replied Manuel gleefully. “I’m glad
I’m not going to be a soldier.”</p>

<p>He continued to visit the Círculo on every day
that he was sent there. At the end of a certain time
he knew every one of the personnel. There were
numerous employees attached to the place; several
dandified <i>croupiers</i> with neat, perfumed hands; a
number of bullies, as many pimps and still others
who kept watch over all visitors and the pimps as
well.</p>

<p>These were all specimens who lacked anything
like a moral sense,—who, some through poverty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hard life, others through inclination to a disorderly
existence, had ruined and beclouded their conscience
and broken the mainspring of will.</p>

<p>Without clearly realizing it, Manuel felt repugnance
for these surroundings and vaguely heard the

<div class="chapter">

<p>El Garro—Marcos Calatrava—The Master—Confidences</p>

</div>

<p>One night Manuel left the Círculo in company
of a puny, sickly looking fellow.
They were both bound in the same direction;
they entered the Café de Lisboa; there the
dwarf met a corpulent woman and sat down at a
table with her. Manuel approached his cousin.</p>

<p>“What were you talking about to him?” asked
Vidal.</p>

<p>“Nothing. About indifferent matters.”</p>

<p>“I warn you that he’s one of the police.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“I should say.”</p>

<p>“But I saw him at the Círculo.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He goes there to collect graft. He’s
married to that fatty he’s with now; her name’s La
Chana, and she’s an old hand at swindling. She
used to live on the Calle de La Visitación when I
went around with Violeta. At that time La Chana
ran a ‘fence.’ She knew every inspector on the
force and lived with a bully called The Minister who
was killed on the Calle de Alcalá. Watch out for
El Garro; if he asks you anything, don’t answer a
word. On the other hand, if you can pump anything
out of him, by all means do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day El Garro again managed to join
Manuel, asking who he was and where he came
from. Manuel, now on his guard, told him a string
of lies with a face of the utmost innocence, pretending
to be the dupe of Vidal and the Cripple.</p>

<p>“I want to tip you off that those fellows are a
pair of shrewd birds,” said the police agent.</p>

<p>“Gee! You don’t say!”</p>

<p>“Uf! It would be better if they were out of
sight! The Cripple, especially, is as crooked as
they make them. Don’t get mixed up with him, for
he’s likely to do anything.”</p>

<p>“Is that how wild he is?”</p>

<p>“You just bet. I know his history, all right,
though he doesn’t know that I do. His name is
Marcos Calatrava, and he comes of good family.
Only two years ago he was studying medicine.”</p>

<p>El Garro related the entire life story of Marcos.
At first he had been an excellent student. Then all
at once he became a habituée of dives and dens, in
one of which he once stole a cape. He was unfortunate
enough to be caught red-handed; they took
him off to the Model Prison and he stayed there two
months. The following year he made up his mind
to give up studying, and since they no longer sent
him money from home he began a life of bullying
around gambling resorts and joints. During a fight
he was stabbed, and for a while this cooled his enthusiasm
for swaggering. When he got well he
went to see the Mother Superior of the San Carlos
Sisters of Charity and asked her for some money.
He wished to become a monk, he said; he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
touched by the divine grace. With his honeyed
speech he convinced the woman; he not only got the
money from her, but also a letter to the prior of a
monastery of Burgos.</p>

<p>Calatrava squandered the money and within two
or three months was at the point of starvation.
Hereupon he organized a company of strolling
players whom he exploited in the most conscienceless
manner, and about a year or so after he had received
the letter from the Mother Superior, during a period
of terrible famine, he came upon it at the bottom of
a trunk and made up his mind to use it. As he was
a man of rapid decisions, he did not hesitate, took
the train without a ticket, and arrived at Burgos
amongst the freight. He presented himself at the
monastery and entered as a novice. Within a short
time he requested them to send him among the
towns collecting alms. At first he was excellent,
even distinguishing himself for his zeal. Soon,
however, he began to commit barbarities, scandalizing
the pious inhabitants of the villages. When
the prior, who had been apprised of his exploits,
sent him an order to return to the monastery,
Calatrava, paying no attention to the command,
continued to swindle the townsfolk. When they
were about to apprehend him, he returned to
Madrid. After three or four months in the capital
he exhausted all his money and his credit, and decided
to enlist in the medical section of the army and
go off to the Philippines.</p>

<p>An army physician, seeing how clever and ready to
assist this Marcos was, tried to help him complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
his course and placed him as an interne in the military
hospital at Manila.</p>

<p>At once Calatrava set about robbing the hospital
pharmacy of medicines, bandages, apparatus,—whatever
he could lay hands upon to sell. He was
discharged; he asked for permanent papers and gave
himself up to exploiting the gamblers in the Manila
dives. As he was so fastidious, life there soon became
impossible for him, whereupon he fell back
upon a military club and succeeded in having them
raise a collection for him. With that money he returned
to Spain.</p>

<p>Once in Madrid he was soon out of funds again,
but as he was not of the kind who drown in a little
water, he enlisted in a battalion of volunteers en
route to Cuba. Marcos won distinction through his
bravery in many a battle, rose soon to a sergeantcy,
when a bullet entered his leg and they had to
amputate it in the Havana Hospital. The fellow
now returned to Spain, with no future ahead of him
and only a ridiculous pension to fall back upon.</p>

<p>Here he went around pretending to be one of the
secret service, tramping the streets, until he took up
with a partner and dedicated himself to burial
swindles, which, despite the extent of their practice,
still yield results to professional imposters. At one
time he formed a society of espadistas and domestics
for the robbing of houses; he forged notes; then
there was no deceit or swindle to which he would not
stoop; and as he was a nimble-witted, clear-eyed fellow,
he made a methodical study of all the known
methods of trickery; he weighed the pros and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
contras of each and every one, and found that they
all had their disadvantages.</p>

<p>“At last,” concluded El Garro, “he met the
Master, who has retired. I don’t know myself
where they got the money for these dives; but the
fact is that they have them.”</p>

<p>“Are there more than one of these Círculos?”
asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“This is the only one that’s open to the public.
But they have the house belonging to the Colonel’s
wife, where much more gambling goes on. That’s
where the Master is every night. Haven’t you ever
been to that house?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“They’ll take you there, all right. If you have
any money to lose, between Vidal and the Cripple
they’ll take you there. Then the Colonel’s wife,
since she’s launching her daughter as a dancer, is
going to open a salon.”</p>

<p>“Is this Colonel’s wife a Cuban?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I know her. And I know a friend of hers,
too, whose name is Mingote.”</p>

<p>The agent eyed Manuel with a certain suspicion.</p>

<p>“Then you may say,” he went on, “that you know
the worst scoundrels in Madrid. Mingote is at
present with Joaquina la Verdeseca. They run a
high-toned house of assignation. Women come
there and leave their photographs. It was Mingote
who organized that celebrated ball. It cost a duro
to get in, and at the end they raffled off a woman:
the daughter of Mingote’s mistress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after this conversation Manuel,
leaving the Círculo and coming upon Vidal, felt the
need of confiding to his cousin the dissatisfaction he
felt with this sort of life. That night Vidal was in
a gloomy mood himself and confided several sad
tales to Manuel, too.</p>

<p>They went to a theatre, but there was no audience
to speak of; they entered a café, and after spending
a terribly cold night Vidal suggested that they go to
La Concha’s, on the Calle de Arlaban, for a bite.</p>

<p>Manuel was averse, for he felt neither like eating
nor like doing anything else. He tagged after
Vidal, however. It was very warm inside; they
took seats and Vidal ordered a couple of whiskys
and cutlets.</p>

<p>“A fellow must forget,” he said, after giving his
order.</p>

<p>Manuel made a gesture of displeasure and
emptied a glass of wine that Vidal had poured out.</p>

<p>Then he told the story that El Garro had related
to him. His cousin drank in every word.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know Calatrava’s life history,” he confessed,
after Manuel had finished.</p>

<p>“Well, tit for tat,” answered Manuel. “You tell
me, now, who is this Master?”</p>

<p>“The Master ... is a colossus. Did you ever
read ‘Rocambole?’”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Vidal paused a while; the figure of Rocambole<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
struck him, no doubt, as most fit for a likeness to the
Master.</p>

<p>“Very well. Then imagine a man like the Cripple.
Get me? But ever so much cleverer; a man who
can imitate any handwriting, who knows four or five
languages, who’s always master of himself, who can
wear a workman’s smock or a frock coat with the
same ease, who can talk to a lady and appear the
finest of gentlemen, and then gossip with a street-walker
and seem a loafer; and add to this that he’s
a sort of clown, that he plays the accordion, that
he can imitate a train, make funny motions and
mock at everybody. And yet, with all this, boy, you
can catch him sometimes half in tears at sight of a
half-naked ragamuffin on the street, or because a
little girl has asked him for an alms.”</p>

<p>“And what’s his name?”</p>

<p>“How should I know? Nobody does. Some
folks say that they knew his father and mother, but
it’s not so. I’ve wondered myself whether he
mightn’t be the illegitimate son of some noble, but
I can’t altogether believe that, for if it had really
been so, it would be shocking that they should have
arrested him, as they did, when he was seventeen.”</p>

<p>“He began early.”</p>

<p>“Yes. They arrested him without cause. He
was in the employ of a fellow who’d managed some
swindle, and they shut him up in the Saladero together
with his employer. He tells the story himself.
One day, it seems, the judge was about to
take a deposition from some prisoner, and as the
clerk was copying the deposition he was taken suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
ill and they had to remove him to his home.
The judge asked the jailer whether they had any
prisoner who could copy down from dictation,
whereupon the jailer summoned the Master. He
sat down in the clerk’s chair, looked over the documents
and began to write. The judge, after the
deposition was over, casts a glance at the papers and
opens his eyes in amazement. It was impossible to
tell where the Master had begun and where the
clerk had left off; the handwriting of one and the
other was the same.</p>

<p>“What a clever rogue!”</p>

<p>“When the Master told this story, he said that
if the judge hadn’t been a stupid ass, he would not
have met such a bad end; but the only thing that occurred
to the judge was to declare that this boy was
a dangerous fellow and that they’d have to keep
a close watch upon him. The Master, who noticed
that they became even more watchful, and this after
he had done them a favour, naturally got angry.
Later, in the Saladero, he became acquainted with
a notorious forger, and between the two of them, in
the prison itself, they did a Frenchman out of forty
thousand duros through a burial certificate.”</p>

<p>“The scoundrels!”</p>

<p>“They got away with five or six tricks of the sort.
At last it was discovered that they were the culprits
and they were prosecuted on fresh charges. They
asked one of them: ‘Who wrote this?’ So one of
them answered, ‘I’. Then they asked the other,
‘Who wrote this?’ And he too answered, ‘I.’
They simply couldn’t discover which it really was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Then it occurred to the judge to have each of them
put into a separate room and made to write the
letter through which they had learned that a
burial was being prepared. And, boy! The two
wrote in the same handwriting, and even made the
same erasures. Just imagine how clever that fellow
must be, if several times, when there have been balls
and banquets at the Royal Palace, he has forged
invitations, has put on a dress suit and gone off to
the king’s residence, rubbing elbows with dukes and
marquises.”</p>

<p>“The deuce you say!” exclaimed Manuel, with
admiration. “And is his companion of the Saladero
still living?”</p>

<p>“No. I believe he died in America.”</p>

<p>“Has the Master ever been to America?”</p>

<p>“He’s been everywhere. He’s travelled over
half the globe, and in every corner of it he has left
behind him some ten or a dozen forgeries.”</p>

<p>“He must be rich.”</p>

<p>“You just bet.”</p>

<p>“And what does he do with his money?”</p>

<p>“That’s something I don’t know. He doesn’t go
in much for good times, nor has he any women.
The Cripple told me once that the Master has
a daughter who’s being brought up in France, and
that he would leave her a fortune.”</p>

<p>“And where does this man live?”</p>

<p>“Over toward Chamberí. I think he spends the
days there reading and playing the guitar, and kissing
his daughter’s photograph.”</p>

<p>“I’d be curious to find out just what he does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you try. I once felt the same curiosity.
One day I saw him leave a bowling alley on the Cuatro
Caminos. ‘Let’s see what this guy is up to,’
I said to myself. I went there the next day and met
him. He was in a jovial mood, playing, chatting,
gesticulating. It seemed that he hadn’t recognized
me. The next day the Cripple says to me:</p>

<p>“‘Don’t return to the place you visited yesterday,
unless you want to break with me forever.’ I
took the hint and never returned.”</p>

<p>The life of this unknown master, so pure and
simple, yet so embroiled in swindlery and deception,
was exceedingly curious. Manuel listened to his
cousin as one who listens to a fairy tale.</p>

<p>“And the Colonel’s wife?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing.... A gawky skirt. She was the
mistress of a watchmaker, who got tired of her
because she’s such an ordinary thing, and then she
tied up with that soldier. She’s a wicked, filthy
old creature.”</p>

<p>“She’s wicked, to be sure. That’s how
she struck me from the first day I laid eyes on
her.”</p>

<p>“Wicked? She’s a wolf, and has an awful
temper. She’s capable of the lowest tricks. Formerly,
when some young gentleman would follow
one of her daughters, she’d have him come into the
house and there she told him that as to her daughters,
there was nothing doing. They could have
her, though. Now she hangs around the barracks.
She’s the cheapest of indecent hags.... But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
what she’s doing with her son is even worse.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Just for the fun of it they dress him
up as a girl and paint him up and don’t call him Luis,
which is his real name, but Luisita la Ricopelo.”</p>

<p>“Christ!” muttered Manuel, bringing his fist down
upon the table. “That’s too much. That ought to
be reported.”</p>

<p>Three men and a girl took seats at the side table.</p>

<p>One of them was a rouged old man with a face
seamed with soft wrinkles and an air of repugnant
cynicism; the other looked like a wig-maker, with
his carefully groomed side-whiskers and his curled
hair; the third, bald, with a red nose and yellow,
matted hair, looked like the symbol of decrepit
youth.</p>

<p>The girl was very pretty; she had a thin nose,
very fine lips, black hair, evenly parted; she wore a
pearl-coloured cape with a collar of feathers; her
mantilla was caught up in her chignon, framing her
face and falling across her bosom.</p>

<p>Her features betrayed a constant restlessness and
a sarcastic expression; she could not keep quiet for
a moment; even when she listened, she fidgeted
about and nervously moved her lips.</p>

<p>The cheeks of the entire quartet were aglow and
their eyes glittered. The bearded fellow kept asking
the girl one question after the other; she answered
with the utmost impudence.</p>

<p>Manuel and Vidal cocked their ears to catch the
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you really believe in free love?” said the
bearded fellow.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t you like to get married?”</p>

<p>“No, sirree.”</p>

<p>“She’s a cold fish,” interrupted he of the side-whiskers.
“She doesn’t understand matters of affection.”</p>

<p>“Bah. I don’t believe that.”</p>

<p>“The trouble with the poor girl is that she’s very
... brutish,” muttered the old man in a whisky-soaked
voice.</p>

<p>“And your wife?” she asked, hitching about in her
seat and looking at the old man out of cold, jesting
eyes. The girl gave the impression of some wasp
or other creature endowed with a sting. Whenever
she was about to say something she changed position,
stung her interlocutor, and sat back, content
and calm for a moment.</p>

<p>The old man mumbled a string of blasphemies.
The fellow with the red whiskers continued his interrogatory
of the girl:</p>

<p>“But haven’t you ever loved anybody?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. What for?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I told you she’s as cold as marble?”
muttered the chap who looked like a wig-maker.</p>

<p>“When I first became acquainted with that guy,”
she went on, laughing and pointing to the fellow
with the side-whiskers, “I had a man who paid for
my room, and the landlady passed as my mother.
Besides, I had other gentleman friends; well, you
see, nobody saw anything wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s terrible,” exclaimed the bearded old man,
filling a glass with wine and gulping it down.
“They don’t care a bit for us, and here we imagine
that they have a heart. But really, in all truth,
tell me, haven’t you ever loved anybody?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. Nobody.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I told you,” repeated the wig-maker’s
double, “that she’s as cold as marble? If you only
knew the crazy things I’ve done for her! I would
ask for her timidly at the porter’s lodge; a month
would go by before I plucked up the courage to
speak to her; and finally, after I’d got her, I discovered
that she was the kind of woman to whom a
fellow may say: ‘Are you free tomorrow at such
and such an hour?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Well, then, see you
tomorrow.’”</p>

<p>“Just as one would speak to a piano-tuner,” interjected
the bearded gentleman, discovering some
relation or other between people and pianos. “It’s
awful,” he added. And then, in an access of anger,
he pounded his fist down upon the table and set all
the glasses dancing.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” asked the old
fellow.</p>

<p>“Nothing. This piggish human brood of ours
ought to be destroyed. I feel that I’m an anarchist.”</p>

<p>“Bah! I think you feel drunk,” interrupted he
of the side-whiskers.</p>

<p>“Holy God! Just because you happen to be an
indecent bourgeois given up to business....”</p>

<p>“You’re more bourgeois than I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>The man with the red nose and the yellow beard
lapsed into an indignant silence; then, turning to the
girl, he said to her in an angry voice:</p>

<p>“Tell that imbecile that when a man of talent
speaks he ought to keep his mouth shut. It’s really
our fault, for we give him the right of belligerency.”</p>

<p>“Poor man!”</p>

<p>“Idiot!”</p>

<p>“You’re more of a bore than any of the articles
you write!” shouted he of the side-whiskers. “And
yet, if all this pride you pretend were only truly felt,
it would be well. But you don’t feel it. You’re
an unfortunate wretch who recognize your own imbecility;
you spend your whole life boring us stiff
with the recitation of articles you’ve already
published,—articles that aren’t even your own, for
you steal them right and left....”</p>

<p>At this the bearded gentleman turned so pale that
his interlocutor cut short his remarks. The trio
continued their conversation in ordinary tones.</p>

<p>All at once the old man broke out into a howl.</p>

<p>“Then he can’t be a respectable person!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked the woman.</p>

<p>“Because he can’t. He must be a carpenter, a
street-sweeper, a thief, or the son of a bad mother,
for I can’t see what reason a respectable person can
have for getting up in the morning.”</p>

<p>Manuel and Vidal had their supper. Shortly
afterward the girl and her three escorts rose from
their places.</p>

<p>“And now a fellow goes home,” grumbled he of
the red whiskers in a funereal tone, “makes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
bed, gets in, lights a cigarette, drinks a glass of
water, urinates and falls asleep. Life is disgusting.”</p>

<p>As the quartet went into the street, Vidal followed
after.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out who she is,” he explained
to Manuel. “See you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“So long.”</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>La Flora and La Aragonesa—La Justa—The Grand
Opening of the Salón París</p>

</div>

<p>The next day Vidal told his cousin that he
had found out who the girl was. Her
name was Flora, she lived on the Calle del
Pez and went to a fashion shop on the Calle de
Barquillo; the place was really a disguised house of
assignation. Vidal meant to win La Flora.</p>

<p>He had already made some progress toward this
conquest when Calatrava, who was satisfied with
Manuel and Vidal, invited them one Sunday afternoon
to a house on the Calle del Barquillo, where
they would meet some good-looking girls and take
them to Los Viveros. That afternoon was filled
for Manuel with terrible emotions. Calatrava,
Vidal and Manuel rode to the fashion shop in a carriage.
They were shown up into a small parlour,
regularly furnished. In a short while La Flora appeared,
accompanied by a tall woman with black eyes
and citreous complexion,—a really fetching wench
who aroused intense enthusiasm in Calatrava.</p>

<p>“Let’s wait till another one shows up,” suggested
Vidal.</p>

<p>They chatted for a while, waiting. Footfalls
were heard in the corridor; a curtain was drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
aside, disclosing a woman. It was La Justa, paler
than before, her eyes blacker than ever, her lips red.
Manuel stared at her in amazement; she turned her
shoulder upon him and tried to sneak out.</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry?” asked Vidal.</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>“Very well. Let’s be going,” said Calatrava.</p>

<p>They left the parlour, and walked down the stairs;
Vidal helped La Flora into the carriage that was
waiting for them; Manuel entered with La Justa;
in another carriage sat Calatrava and the tall, black-eyed
woman. They rode toward the Puerta del
Sol, and afterward, through the Plaza de Oriente to
La Bombilla.</p>

<p>In their carriage, Vidal and Flora were talking
away without pause for breath; La Justa and
Manuel were silent as the tomb.</p>

<p>The lunch was a sad affair for this couple; when
it was finished, Vidal and Calatrava disappeared.
La Justa and Manuel remained seated before the
table, at a loss for words. Manuel was penetrated
by a grievous sadness, the complete annihilation of
existence.</p>

<p>Toward nightfall the three couples returned to
Madrid and had supper in a room of the Café
Habanero.</p>

<p>They all exchanged confidences; each recounted
his life and miracles, with the exception of La Justa,
who did not open her mouth.</p>

<p>“I entered the business,” said La Flora, “because
it was all I had ever seen in my own house. I never
knew what a father or mother meant; until I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
fifteen I lived with some aunts of mine who were
as bad as myself. Only they were a happier sort.
The elder of them had a boy, and she’d leave him in
the drawer of a bureau, which she had turned into
a bed. They hadn’t any clothes, and if one went out
the other would have to stay home; they wore the
same pair of shoes and the same skirts. Whenever
they found themselves without funds they would
write to a woman who ran a house, would answer
her call, and come back happily with their money.
They wanted to place me in a shop, but says I,
‘Nothing doing; if I must go to work, me for the
gay life,’ and I went into the business.”</p>

<p>The other woman, she who was tall and beautiful,
spoke with a certain bitterness. They called her
Petra la Aragonesa.</p>

<p>“As for me,” she began, “I was dishonoured by
a young gentleman; I lived in Zaragoza, and went
right into the business. As my father lives there,
and is a carpenter, and my brothers as well, I
thought of coming to Madrid so as to spare them
the shame. So a chum of mine and myself planned
to make the journey together. We each had about
ten duros or more when we reached Madrid. At
the station we take a carriage, stop at a café, eat,
and then start out doing the streets. At a certain
corner, I believe it was on the Plaza de los
Mostenses, in a lane that I couldn’t place or name
for the life of me, we see a house with the windows
all lit up, and hear the sound of a barrel-organ. In
we go; two fellows started to dance with us and took
us off to a house in the Calle de San Marcos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“The next day, when I got up, my man says to me:
‘Go on and bring the money you’ve got with you, and
we’ll eat right here.’ I answered that there was
nothing doing. Then another guy showed up and
took us through the house; it was rigged up fine,
with sofas and mirrors. He offered us some whisky
and cake, and invited us to remain there. I didn’t
want to take anything, and left the place. The
other girl gave every peseta she had to her man,
and stayed. Afterward that guy took everything
she earned and beat her into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“And is your companion still living at that
house?” asked Vidal.</p>

<p>“No. They transferred her to a house in Lisbon
for forty-five dollars.”</p>

<p>“Why did she go?”</p>

<p>La Aragonesa shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“The fact is that the women in this business are
beastly stupid,” said Vidal. “They have no sense,
they don’t know their rights, nor nothing.”</p>

<p>“And how about you?” asked Calatrava of La
Justa.</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders but did not part
her lips.</p>

<p>“She must be some Russian princess,” snarled La
Flora.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” retorted La Justa dryly. “I’m
just what you are. A common woman.”</p>

<p>They finished their supper and each couple went
off in a different direction. Manuel accompanied
La Justa as far as the Calle de Jacometrezo, where
she lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>As they reached the entrance to the house Manuel
was about to take leave, averting his glance, when
she said to him: “Wait.” The watchman opened
for them, she gave him ten céntimos, he gave her a
long wax match after lighting it in his lantern, and
she and Manuel began to ascend the staircase. The
flickering light of the wax match made the shadows
of the two fall alternately huge and small upon the
walls. Reaching the third floor La Justa opened
a door with a latch-key and they both entered a
narrow room with an alcove. La Justa lighted an
oil lamp and sat down; Manuel followed her example.</p>

<p>Never had Manuel felt so wretched as on that
night. He could not understand why La Justa had
asked him to come up with her; he felt inhibited
in her presence and did not dare to ask her anything.</p>

<p>After they had exchanged a few indifferent words,
Manuel managed to say to her:</p>

<p>“And your father?”</p>

<p>“He’s well.”</p>

<p>All at once, without any warning, La Justa burst
into tears. She must have been overwhelmed by an
irrepressible desire to tell Manuel her life’s story,
and so she did, with many a sigh and broken
word.</p>

<p>The butcher’s son, after taking her out of the
shop where she worked, had dishonoured her and infected
her with a loathsome disease; then he
abandoned her and escaped to Madrid. A single
recourse remained open to her: she must go to the
hospital. When her father went to San Juan de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Dios and saw her lying flat on her back with rubber
tubes thrust into her open groins, he was on the
point of killing her then and there, and in a voice vibrating
with fury declared that his daughter was
dead to him. She burst into disconsolate tears; a
woman in a neighbouring bed said to her: “Why
don’t you go into the business?” But her only
answer was to weep harder than ever. When she
was discharged she went back to the workshop, but
the forelady would have none of her. It was now
night, and she left the place ready for anything.
She happened to be on the Calle Mayor; a man happened
by, swinging a cane, and said to her: “Come
along with me.” They walked down the street together,
and that man brought her to the station; they
climbed to the top story and walked through a dark
corridor into a room lighted by electricity. It was
full of women who were chatting and laughing with
the officials. At the end of some time a gentleman
began to read a list and the women filed out. Only
some twenty or thirty of the most filthy and tattered
remained. They were ordered down several flights
of stairs and locked into a cell.</p>

<p>“I spent a desperate night there,” concluded La
Justa. “The next day they took me to be examined
and gave me a certificate.”</p>

<p>Manuel could not find a word of solace; La Justa,
sensing his coldness, mastered her emotion. They
continued to chat. Then Manuel tranquilly gave
an account of his own adventures; one recollection
interwove with another, and they talked and talked
unwearyingly. As they sat thus conversing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
flame of the lamp flickered for a moment and with a
gentle sputter went out.</p>

<p>“That, too, is accident,” said La Justa.</p>

<p>“No. It must have run out of oil,” replied
Manuel. “Very well. I guess I’ll be going.”</p>

<p>He rummaged through his pockets. There were
no matches.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you any matches?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Manuel got up and groped about; he stumbled
against the table, then, striking a chair, he paused.</p>

<p>La Justa opened the balcony shutter that faced
the street, thus allowing Manuel sufficient light to
find his way to the door.</p>

<p>“Have you the house key?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then how am I to get out?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to call the watchman.”</p>

<p>They walked out to the balcony; the night was
cold, the sky studded with stars. They waited for
the watchman’s lantern to appear.</p>

<p>La Justa nestled close up to Manuel; he placed
his arm around her waist. They spoke no more;
they closed the shutters and hastened through the
darkness toward the alcove.</p>

<p>They must accept things as they came. Manuel
promised La Justa that he would find some honest
means of earning a modest living, and that he’d take
her out of this life at once. La Justa wept tears
of deep emotion upon Manuel’s shoulder. Despite
the fascinating plans of regeneration which they
formulated that night, Manuel made no efforts whatsoever;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the one thing he did was to come and live
with La Justa. At times the couple were filled with
deep repugnance for the life they led, and would
quarrel and hurl insults at each other upon the
slightest provocation; but they made peace directly
after.</p>

<p>Every night, while Manuel slept in that hole after
many hours at the gambling den, La Justa would return
exhausted with her round of the cafés, restaurants
and houses of assignation. In the livid light
of daybreak her checks were of a filthy hue and her
smile was the essence of sadness.</p>

<p>There were times when she fell staggering into the
room, dead drunk; as she entered the house and
stumbled alone up the stairs, she was filled with a
haunting fear and deep remorse. Dawn brought
to her, as it were, an awakening of conscience.</p>

<p>Reaching the room, she would open the door with
her latch-key, enter and lie down beside him, trembling
with the cold but careful not to waken him.</p>

<p>Manuel grew quickly accustomed to this new life
and the new friendships it brought; he was too lazy
and too timorous to make any attempt at changing.
Some Sunday afternoons La Justa and he would go
for a stroll to the Cuatro Caminos or the Puerta de
Hierro, and when they did not quarrel they discussed
their illusions,—a change of luck that would fall into
their laps without any effort on their part, as a gift
from Providence.</p>

<p class="tb">During this winter the proprietors of the Círculo
installed upon the lower floor, which was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
occupied by the café, a new venture,—the Salón
París; upon the list of the sensational beauties who
would grace the salon appeared dancers and singers
of the most widespread reputation: the Dahlias,
Gardenias, Magnolias, and so forth. In addition,
as a special attraction, there was announced the
début of Chuchita, the daughter of the Colonel’s
wife. Both as mother and as impresaria she was
doing her best to exploit her child. On the day of
the child’s first public performance the mother distributed
the claque over the whole house. Vidal,
the Cripple and Manuel, in their capacity as chief
claqueurs, occupied one of the first rows of seats.</p>

<p>“You’ll all applaud, won’t you?” asked the
Colonel’s wife.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” answered Calatrava. “And
if anybody doesn’t like it, just look at the fine argument
I’m carrying.” He showed his cudgel.</p>

<p>Chuchita followed a hypnotizer upon the bill; she
appeared to a salvo of applause. She danced without
any suggestion of grace, and no sooner had she
finished her song and danced the tango that followed
it, than the stage was littered with floral wreaths
and other gifts. After the conclusion of the part in
which Chuchita appeared, Manuel and Vidal joined
a number of newspaper men, among whom were two
friends of the sculptor Alex, and together they all
proceeded to offer their congratulations to the father
of Chuchita.</p>

<p>They summoned the watchman and went into the
house. The servant asked them to pass to the
Colonel’s room. That worthy was in bed, calmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
smoking. They all trooped into the bedchamber.</p>

<p>“Congratulations, dear Colonel.”</p>

<p>The gentleman who was such a stickler for military
honour received these felicitations without any
realization of the sarcasm that flowed beneath.</p>

<p>“And how was it? Really, how was it?” asked
the father from his bed.</p>

<p>“Very good. At first a trifle timid, but very soon
she let loose.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Dancers are like soldiers; as soon
as they reach the field of battle, their courage rises.”</p>

<p>Everybody, the journalists and the rabble that had
tagged after them, greeted the epigram with derisive
laughter. They left the colonel and went back to
the Salón París.</p>

<p>The Colonel’s wife, Chuchita and her blond
sister, accompanied by a Senator, a newspaper man
and a well-known bull-fighter, were getting ready for
supper in one of the Círculo’s private rooms.</p>

<p>According to popular gossip, Chuchita showed a
decided inclination toward the bull-fighter, and the
Colonel’s wife not only did not seek to dissuade her,
but had actually sent for the torero so that Chuchita’s
début might be in every way a pleasant event
for the child....</p>

<p>The opening of the Salón París gave Manuel and
Vidal opportunity to make new acquaintances.</p>

<p>Vidal had become friends with Chuchita’s brother,
who hung about the theatre as a pimp, and the
youngster took Vidal and Manuel to the dancers’
greenroom.</p>

<p>When La Justa discovered the sort of friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Manuel was now consorting with she raised a terrible
row. La Justa had become bent upon making
Manuel’s life intolerable, and when she wasn’t upbraiding
him and telling him that he was nothing but
a loafer who sponged on her earnings, she was exhibiting
the wildest jealousy. Whenever she had
one of these outbursts Manuel would shrug his
shoulders resignedly, while La Justa, plunged for
the nonce into the depths of despair, would throw
herself prone upon the floor and lie there motionless,
as if dead. Then her paroxysm of anger
would pass, and she would be so quiet....</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>An Execution—On the Sotillo Bridge—Destiny</p>

</div>

<p>It was a night in August; Manuel, Vidal, La
Flora and La Justa had just left El Dorado
theatre, when Vidal suggested:</p>

<p>“They’re executing a soldier at daybreak. Shall
we take it in?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Let’s go,” answered La Flora and La
Justa.</p>

<p>It was a balmy, beautiful night.</p>

<p>They went up the Calle Alcalá and entered the
Fornos. At about three they left the Café and took
an open hack for the place of the execution.</p>

<p>They left the carriage opposite the Model Prison.</p>

<p>It was too early. It had not yet dawned.</p>

<p>They circled around the prison by a side-street
that was no more than a ditch running through the
sand and finally reached the clearings near the Calle
de Rosales. The structure of the Model Prison,
viewed from these desolate fields, assumed an imposing
appearance; it looked like a fort bathing
there in the blue, spectral illumination of the arc
lights. From time to time the sentinels sang out a
prolonged watchword that produced a terrible impression
of anguish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a sad house!” murmured Vidal. “And to
think of all the people shut up in it!”</p>

<p>“Pse.... Let them all be shot,” replied La
Justa, indifferently.</p>

<p>But Vidal could not feel this disdain, and grew
indignant at La Justa’s remark.</p>

<p>“Then what do they rob for?” she countered.</p>

<p>“And you, why do you ...?”</p>

<p>“Because I need to eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, they need to eat, too.”</p>

<p>La Flora now recalled that as a little girl she had
witnessed the execution of La Higinia. She had
gone with the janitress’s daughter.</p>

<p>“There’s where the scaffold was,” and she pointed
to the middle of a wall opposite the death-house.
“The clearings were jammed with people. La
Higinia came along dressed all in black, leaning
against the Brethren of Peace and Charity. She
must have been dead from fright already. They
sat her down on the stool and a priest with a raised
cross in his hand stood before her; the executioner
tied her feet with rope, catching her skirts in the
knot; then he blindfolded her with a black handkerchief
and getting behind her gave two turns to
the wheel. Right away he removed the handkerchief
from her face and the woman fell stiff upon the
boards.</p>

<p>“Then,” concluded La Flora, “the other girl and
myself had to run off, for the guards charged the
crowd.”</p>

<p>Vidal paled at this detailed recital of an execution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“These things take the life out of me,” he said,
placing one hand over his heart.</p>

<p>“Then why did you want to come here?” asked
Manuel. “Do you want to turn back?”</p>

<p>“No. No.”</p>

<p>They proceeded to the Plaza de Moncloa. At
one of the corners of the prison was a seething
throng. Day was breaking. A border of gold was
beginning to glow on the horizon. Through the
Calle de la Princesa came trooping a company of
artillery; it looked phantasmal in the hazy light of
dawn. The company came to a halt before the
prison.</p>

<p>“Now let’s see whether they’ll give us the slip and
shoot him somewhere else,” muttered a little old
fellow, to whom the idea of getting up so early in
the morning and then being cheated out of an execution
must have appeared as the height of the disagreeable.</p>

<p>“They’re executing him over toward San Bernardino,”
announced a ragamuffin.</p>

<p>There was a general stampede for the scene of the
execution. And indeed, just below some clearings
near the Paseo de Areneros the soldiers had formed
into a square. There was an audience of actors,
night-owls, chorus-girls and prostitutes seated
around in hacks, and a throng of loafers and beggars.
The barren area was fairly vast. A grey
wagon came rumbling along at top speed directly
into the centre of the square; three figures stepped
down, looking from the distance like dolls; the men
beside the criminal removed their high hats. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
soldier who was to be executed could not be seen
very well.</p>

<p>“Down with your heads!” cried the crowd at the
rear. “Let everybody have a chance to see!”
Eight cavalrymen stepped forward with short rifles
in their hands and took up a position in front of the
condemned man. Not exactly opposite him,
naturally, for, moving along sideways like an animal
with many feet, they proceeded several metres.
The sun shot brilliant reflections from the yellow
sand of the clearing, from the helmets and the belts
of the soldiers. No voice of command was heard;
the rifles took aim.</p>

<p>“Put down your heads!” came again in angry accents
from those who were in the third and fourth
row of the spectators.</p>

<p>A detonation, not very loud, rang out. Shortly
afterwards came another.</p>

<p>“That’s the finishing touch,” muttered Vidal.</p>

<p>The audience broke up and made off toward
Madrid. There was the roll of drums and the blare
of bugles. The sun glowed in the window panes of
the houses nearby. Manuel, Vidal and the two
women were walking through the Paseo de Areneros
when they heard the crack of another discharge.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t dead yet,” added Vidal, paler than
ever.</p>

<p>The four became moody.</p>

<p>“I tell you what,” spoke up Vidal. “I have an
idea for wiping away the unpleasant impression
this has made upon us. Let’s go for a little excursion
and lunch this afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Over by the river. It’ll remind us of the good
old days. Eh. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Right-o.”</p>

<p>“La Justa won’t be busy?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Settled, then. At noon we’ll all meet at Señora
Benita’s restaurant, near the Pier and Sotillo
Bridge.”</p>

<p>“Agreed.”</p>

<p>“And now let’s be off to catch a snooze.”</p>

<p>Which they did. At twelve Manuel and La Justa
left the house and made their way to the restaurant.
The others had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>They sat down upon a bench; La Justa was in
bad humour. She bought ten céntimos’ worth of
peanuts and began to nibble at them.</p>

<p>“Want any?” she asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“No. They get into my teeth.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t want any, either,” and she threw
them to the ground.</p>

<p>“What do you buy them for, if you throw them
away afterward?”</p>

<p>“Because I feel like it.”</p>

<p>“Suits me. Do as you please.”</p>

<p>For an appreciable period they sat there waiting,
neither breaking the silence. La Justa, at last beyond
her patience, got up.</p>

<p>“I’m going home,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” replied Manuel.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, then, and may they darn you with
black thread, you thief.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Manuel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“And give you blood pudding.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>La Justa, who was on the point of leaving, caught
sight just then of Calatrava and La Aragonesa, and
Vidal in company of La Flora. She paused. Calatrava
had a guitar with him.</p>

<p>An organ-grinder happened to be passing the
restaurant. The Cripple stopped him and they
danced to his tunes, Vidal with La Flora, La Justa
with Manuel.</p>

<p>Now new couples appeared, among them a fat,
flat-nosed virago dressed in ridiculous fashion and
accompanied by a fellow with mutton-chop whiskers
and the general appearance of a gipsy. La Justa,
who was in an insolent, provocative mood, began to
laugh at the fat woman. The aggrieved party replied
in a depreciative, sarcastic voice, scoring each
word:</p>

<p>“These cheap fly-by-nights....”</p>

<p>“The dirty whore!” muttered La Justa, and began
to sing this tango in a lowered voice, turning toward
the fat woman as she did so:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Eres más fea que un perro de presa,</div>
<div class="verse">y á presumida no hay quién te gane.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">You’re uglier far than a bull-dog</div>
<div class="verse">And for impudence no one can beat you.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Low-life!” grunted the virago.</p>

<p>The man with the gipsy appearance went over to
Manuel and informed him that that lady (La Justa)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
was insulting his own, and this was something he
could not permit. Manuel was well aware that the
man was in the right; yet, despite this, he made an
insolent reply. Vidal intervened, and after many an
explanation on both sides, it was decided that nobody
had been insulted and the matter was composed.
But La Justa was bent upon trouble and
got into a scrape with one of the organ grinders,
who was an impudent rascal by very virtue of his
calling.</p>

<p>“Shut up, damn it all!” shouted Calatrava at La
Justa. “And you, too, close your trap,” he cried to
the organ grinder. “For if you don’t, you’re going
to feel this stick.”</p>

<p>“Let’s better go inside,” suggested Vidal.</p>

<p>The three couples proceeded to a veranda
furnished with tables and rustic chairs; a wooden
balustrade ran along the side that overlooked the
Manzanares river.</p>

<p>In the middle of the stream were two islets
mantled with shining verdure, between which a
number of planks served as a bridge from one bank
to the other.</p>

<p>Lunch was brought, but La Justa had no appetite,
nor would she deign a reply to any questions.
Shortly afterward, for no reason whatsoever, she
burst into bitter tears, amidst the cruel bantering of
La Flora and La Aragonesa. Then she grew
calm and was soon as happy and jovial as could
be.</p>

<p>They ate a sumptuous meal and left for a moment
to dance on the road to the tunes of the barrel organ.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Several times, it seemed to Manuel, he caught sight
of El Bizco in front of the restaurant.</p>

<p>“Can it be Bizco? What can he be looking for
around here?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>Toward nightfall the three couples went in,
turned on the light in their room and sent for whisky
and coffee. For a long time they chatted. Calatrava
related with evident delight a number of
horrors out of the war with Cuba. In that conflict
he had satisfied his natural instincts of cruelty, slicing
negroes, razing mills, spreading fire and destruction
in his path.</p>

<p>The three women, especially La Aragonesa, were
filled with enthusiasm by his tales. All at once
Calatrava lapsed into silence, as if some sad memory
had stemmed his garrulousness.</p>

<p>Vidal took up the guitar and sang the <i>Espartero</i>
tango with deep feeling. Then he hummed the tune
of <i>La Tempranica</i> very charmingly, enunciating the
phrases sharply so as to give them fuller savour, and
placing his hand over the orifice at times so as to
mute the sound. La Flora struck a number of
merry poses while Vidal, affecting a gipsy style, sang
on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ze coman los mengues,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">mardita la araña,</div>
<div class="verse">que tié en la barriga</div>
<div class="verse indent1">pintá una guitarra!</div>
<div class="verse">Bailando ze cura</div>
<div class="verse indent1">tan jondo doló....</div>
<div class="verse">Ay! Malhaya la araña</div>
<div class="verse indent1">que a mí me picó.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Marcos Calatrava seized the instrument.
He was no player like Vidal; he could simply strum
a few chords gently, monotonously. Marcos sang
a Cuban song,—sad, languid, filled with a communicative
longing for some tropical land. It was a
lengthy narrative that evoked the negro danzón, the
glorious nights of the tropics, the fatherland, the
blood of slain soldiers, the flag, which brings tears to
one’s eyes, the memory of the rout ... an exotic,
yet intimate piece, exceedingly sorrowful,—and
something beautifully plebeian and sad.</p>

<p>At the sound of these songs Manuel was inspired
with the great, proud, gory idea of the fatherland.
He pictured it as a proud woman, with glittering
eyes and terrible gesture, standing beside a
lion....</p>

<p>Then Calatrava sang, to the monotonous accompaniment
of his strumming, a very languorous, doleful
song of the insurgents. One of the stanzas,
which Calatrava sang in the Cuban dialect, ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Pinté a Matansa confusa,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">la playa de Viyamá,</div>
<div class="verse">y no he podido pintá</div>
<div class="verse indent1">el nido de la lechusa;</div>
<div class="verse">yo pinté po donde crusa</div>
<div class="verse indent1">un beyo ferrocarrí,</div>
<div class="verse">un machete y un fusí</div>
<div class="verse indent1">y una lancha cañonera,</div>
<div class="verse">y no pinté la bandera,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">por la que voy a morí.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For some reason which Manuel could not fathom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the incongruous mixture that appeared in the song
filled him with a vast sadness....</p>

<p>It was darkling outside. Afar, the saffron-hued
soil was gleaming with the dying quivers of the sun,
which was hidden by clouds that looked like fiery
dragons; a tower here, a tree there, yonder a ramshackle
shanty, broke the straight, monotonous line
of the horizon. The western sky was a caldron of
flames.</p>

<p>Then came darkness; the fields sank into gloom
and the sun disappeared.</p>

<p>Over the tiny plank bridge that reached from
one bank to the other passed a procession of dark
women with bundles of clothes under their
arms.</p>

<p>Manuel was overwhelmed by an all-engulfing
anguish. From the distance, out of some restaurant,
came the far-off droning of a guitar.</p>

<p>Vidal ran out of the veranda.</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” he cried.</p>

<p>A moment ... and a wail of despair rang out.
They all jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>“Was that Vidal?” asked La Flora.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Calatrava, laying the
guitar upon the table.</p>

<p>There was a din of voices in the direction of the
river. All the patrons of the place dashed over to
the balcony that looked out upon the Manzanares.
Upon one of the green islets two men were engaged
in a hand-to-hand struggle. One of them was Vidal;
he could be recognized by his white Cordovan hat.
La Flora, making sure it was he, uttered a shriek of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
terror. In an instant the two men had separated
and Vidal fell headlong to the ground, without a
sound. The other man placed his knee upon the
fallen man’s back and must have plunged his dirk
into him some ten or a dozen times. Then he ran
into the river, reached the other side and disappeared.</p>

<p>Calatrava and Manuel let themselves down over
the veranda balustrade and ran across the plank
bridge to the little island.</p>

<p>Vidal was stretched face downward in a pool of
blood. The dirk was thrust into his neck, near the
nape. Calatrava pulled at the handle, but the
weapon must have penetrated into the vertebrae.
Then Marcos turned the body half way around and
placed his hand over the man’s heart.</p>

<p>“He’s dead,” he pronounced, calmly.</p>

<p>Manuel eyed the corpse with horror. The dying
light of evening was reflected in its widely opened
eyes. Calatrava replaced the body in the position
in which they had found it. They returned to the
restaurant.</p>

<p>“Let’s be off at once,” said Marcos.</p>

<p>“And Vidal?” asked La Flora.</p>

<p>“He’s given up the ghost.”</p>

<p>La Flora broke into a wail, but Calatrava seized
her violently by the arm and enforced silence.</p>

<p>“Come on ... clear out,” he ordered. With
the utmost self-composure he paid the bill, took his
guitar and they all left the restaurant.</p>

<p>It was now night; in the distance, Madrid, a pale
coppery hue, rose against the soft, melancholy, azure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
sky which was streaked in the west by long purplish
and greenish bands. The stars began to shine and
twinkle languidly; the river shot back silvery reflections.</p>

<p>Silently they crossed the Toledo Bridge, each one
given up to his own meditations and fears. At the
end of the Paseo de los Ocho Hilos they found two
carriages; Calatrava, La Aragonesa and La Flora
stepped into one, and La Justa and Manuel got into
the other.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p>The Police Court Dungeon—Digressions—Manuel’s Statement</p>

</div>

<p>On the day following the death of his cousin
Manuel eagerly bought the newspapers;
they all had accounts of the murder at the
restaurant; the customers present at the time were
clearly described; Vidal’s body had been identified
and it had been established that the assassin was El
Bizco, a jail bird who had already been tried for two
robberies, and assaults, and the alleged perpetrator
of a murder committed upon the Aravaca road.</p>

<p>La Justa and Manuel were thrown into a terrible
panic; they feared lest they should be involved
in the crime and be summoned to testify; they were
completely at a loss.</p>

<p>After much cogitation, they decided that the most
sensible course would be to move off somewhere into
the suburbs. La Justa and Manuel sought a place,
finding one at last in a house on the Calle de Galileo,
near the Tercer Depósito, in Vallehermoso.</p>

<p>The rent was cheap,—three duros per month.
The house had two balconies, which looked out upon
a large clearing or vacant lot where the stone cutters
hewed large boulders. This lot was marked off by
a wall of chips left over from the stone cutting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
in the centre was a shack where the watchman lived
with his family.</p>

<p>The rooms were flooded with light from sunrise to
sunset. Save for the terror produced in Manuel by
Vidal’s tragic end or by some inner impulse thus
stirred, Manuel felt his soul quiver with eagerness to
begin life anew; he hunted work and found it in a
printing-shop of Chamberí. This being shut up all
day within the walls of the shop was a violent trial
for him; but the very violence that he was forced to
practise upon himself gave him courage to persevere.
La Justa, on the other hand, found the time heavy
on her hands and went about forever in a glum,
moody humour.</p>

<p>One Saturday, after a week of this exemplary life,
Manuel returned to the house and did not find
La Justa waiting for him. He spent a restless
night hoping for her to come back; she did not
appear.</p>

<p>The next day she did not return, either; Manuel
broke into tears. He understood now that she had
deserted him. This was the cruel awakening from
a wondrous dream; he had flattered himself that at
last they two had risen out of wretched poverty and
dishonour.</p>

<p>During the previous days he had heard La Justa
complain of headache, of lack of appetite; but never
had he suspected this plot, never could he have believed
that she would abandon him like this, in such
cold blood.</p>

<p>And he felt so alone, so miserable, so cowed
again! This room, inundated with sunshine, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
formerly he had found so cheery, now seemed sad
and sombre. From the balcony he gazed out upon
the distant houses with their red roofs. Far off
lay Madrid, bathed in a clear, bright atmosphere
under a golden sun. Some white clouds sailed
slowly, majestically by, dissolving and re-forming
into their fantastic shapes.</p>

<p>Workingmen’s families, dressed in their Sunday
best, tripped by in groups; faintly there came the
gay strains of the barrel-organs.</p>

<p>Manuel sat down upon the bed and pondered.
How many excellent projects, how many plans
cherished in his mind had come to nought in his soul!
Here he was, only at the beginning of life, and already
he felt himself without the strength to fight
the battle. Not a hope, not an illusion smiled at
him. Work? What for? Set up one column
after another of type, walk to work and then back to
the house, day in and day out, sleep,—all for what?
He was bereft of plan, idea, inspiration. He
stared into the merry Sunday afternoon, the splashing
sunlight,—gazed at the blue heavens, the distant
spires....</p>

<p>Immersed in his hazy thoughts Manuel did not
hear the knocking at the door; it grew louder with
each repetition.</p>

<p>“Can it be La Justa?” he thought. “Impossible.”</p>

<p>Yet he opened the door in the vague hope of confronting
her. Two men greeted his sight.</p>

<p>“Manuel Alcázar,” declared one of them, “you
are under arrest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“The judge will tell you. Slip into your shoes
and come along with us.”</p>

<p>“Am I going to be locked up?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Not unless you do something foolish. Up!
Get a move on!”</p>

<p>The three men reached the street and walked to
the Paseo de Areneros.</p>

<p>“We’ll take a tram,” said one of the policemen.</p>

<p>They entered the tram; it was so crowded that
they were compelled to remain upon the platform.
Reaching the Plaza de Santa Barbara they got off,
and crossing two or three thoroughfares they
brought up before Las Salesas; here they turned a
corner, passed through a gate, and walked down a
long passageway at the end of which was a dungeon.
They thrust Manuel in and locked the cell from outside.</p>

<p class="tb">They say that solitude and silence are, as it were,
the father and mother of deep thoughts. Manuel,
in the midst of this silence and solitude, could not
discover the most insignificant idea. And speaking
of discovery, he could not discover even in the
world of phenomena a place where to sit; nor was
this so strange, for there wasn’t a chair or bench,
however humble, in the hole. Dejected and exhausted,
he sank to the ground. He lay thus for
several hours; all at once a pale illumination entered
from above the door, through a transom.</p>

<p>“They’ve put on the lights,” said Manuel to himself.
“It must be night now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment there was a din of shouts and wails.</p>

<p>“You’d better obey orders, now, or you’ll be the
worse off for it,” said a grave voice.</p>

<p>“But señor officer, I’m not the man. I’m not the
man,” protested a supplicating prisoner. “Please
let me go home.”</p>

<p>“Come along with you. Get inside!”</p>

<p>“In God’s name! For the love of God! I’m
not the man.”</p>

<p>“In with you!”</p>

<p>There was the noise of the man being pushed into
the dungeon, followed by the violent slamming of
the door. The entreating voice continued to cry
with wearing monotony:</p>

<p>“I’m not the man.... I’m not the man....
I’m not the man.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, here’s a bore for you!” said Manuel
to himself. “If he runs on like that all night
long, I’m in for a fine time!”</p>

<p>Little by little his neighbour’s lamentations
abated, finally subsiding into a silent weeping.
From the corridor came the rhythmic footfalls of
some one who was pacing up and down.</p>

<p>Manuel rummaged desperately through his mind
for some idea, if only to amuse himself with it; he
could find nothing. The one conclusion he could
reach was that it had grown light.</p>

<p>Such a lack of ideas led him, as if by the hand,
into a deep slumber, which in all likelihood did not
last more than a couple of hours, yet to him seemed
a year. He awoke all mauled up, with a cramp in
his side; throughout his sleep he had not been able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
to shake off the realization that he was in a cell,
but his brief period of rest had been so restorative
that he felt strong, ready for whatever should
arise.</p>

<p>He still had in his pocket the wages he had received
at the printing-shop. Softly he knocked at
the cell door.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” came the query from outside.</p>

<p>“I’d like to step out for a moment.”</p>

<p>“Step out.”</p>

<p>He walked into the corridor.</p>

<p>“Could you fetch me a coffee?” he asked of
a guard.</p>

<p>“If you pay for it....”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll pay. Send for a cup of coffee and
toast, and a package of cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“Right away,” said the guard.</p>

<p>“What’s the time?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“Twelve.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t have to stick in that hole I’d invite
you to have a coffee with me; but....”</p>

<p>“You can have it out here. There’s enough in
one cup for two.”</p>

<p>A waiter came with the coffee and cigarettes.
They sipped the coffee, smoked a cigarette, and the
guard, already won over, said to Manuel:</p>

<p>“Take one of these benches in with you to sleep
on.”</p>

<p>Manuel took a bench and stretched out at full
length. On the previous day, though free, he had
felt weak and crestfallen; now, though in custody,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
he felt strong. Plans piled up in his thoughts, but
he could not sleep.</p>

<p>Physical exhaustion consumes the strength and
excites the brain; the imagination wings in the darkness
as do nocturnal birds; and, again like them, it
takes refuge in ruins.</p>

<p>Manuel did not sleep; but he dreamed and
planned a thousand things; some logical, the majority
of them absurd. The light of day, filtering
dimly in through the transom, scattered his ideas
upon the future and restored him to thoughts of
the immediate present.</p>

<p>They would soon be along to take him before the
judge. Now what was he going to answer? He’d
cook up a story. Accident had brought him to the
Sotillo Bridge; he did not know Calatrava. But
suppose they confronted him with these people?
He’d surely get all muddled. It would be better to
come right out with the truth and soften it down as
much as he could, so as to favour his case. He had
become acquainted with Calatrava through his
cousin; he saw him from time to time at the Salón;
he worked in a printing-shop....</p>

<p>He had just about decided upon this plan when
a guard entered the cell.</p>

<p>“Manuel Alcázar.”</p>

<p>“At your service.”</p>

<p>“Proceed to the judge’s room.”</p>

<p>The two men filed down a long corridor and the
guard knocked at a door.</p>

<p>“Have we your grace’s permission?” asked the
guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>They entered an office with two large windows
that afforded a view of the trees on the square. Before
the desk was the judge, seated in a high-backed
chair. Opposite the desk was a closet in the Gothic
style, filled with books. A clerk kept entering and
leaving, carrying heaps of documents under his arm;
the judge would ask him a stray question and then
hurriedly sign a paper.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the guard, cap in hand, approached
the judge and informed him in a few words
as to Manuel. The magistrate threw a hurried
glance at the boy, who, at that moment, was thinking:</p>

<p>“I’ll have to tell the truth; for, if I don’t,
they’ll tear it out of me and it’ll be so much the
worse.”</p>

<p>This decision infused him with a great tranquillity.</p>

<p>“Step closer,” said the judge.</p>

<p>Manuel came over to the desk.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Manuel Alcázar.”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one.”</p>

<p>“Trade?”</p>

<p>“Typesetter.”</p>

<p>“Do you swear to answer the truth to all questions
put to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“If you do, then may Heaven reward you for it;
if you don’t, may it visit proper punishment upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
you. What did you do on the day of the crime?”</p>

<p>“On the night before, Vidal and myself, together
with two women, went to see the execution of a
soldier. After that we slept for a while in the
morning, and at eleven I went with a woman to the
restaurant near the Sotillo Bridge, where we had an
appointment with Vidal.”</p>

<p>“What relation are you to the murdered man?”</p>

<p>“I was his cousin.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever quarrel with him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did you make a living up to the day on
which Vidal died?”</p>

<p>“I lived on gambling.”</p>

<p>“What did you do to live on gambling?”</p>

<p>“I played with the money that was given to me, at
the Círculo de la Amistad, and I handed over my
winnings sometimes to Vidal and other times to a
lame fellow named Calatrava.”</p>

<p>“What offices did Vidal and this cripple fill at the
Círculo?”</p>

<p>“The Cripple was secretary to the Master, and
Vidal was secretary to the Cripple.”</p>

<p>“What’s the Cripple’s real name?”</p>

<p>“Marcos Calatrava.”</p>

<p>“Through whom did you come to know the
Cripple?”</p>

<p>“Through Vidal.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At the Majo de las Cubas tavern, over on the
Calle Mayor.”</p>

<p>“How long since is this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“A year.”</p>

<p>“Who took you into the Círculo de la Amistad?”</p>

<p>“Vidal.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a fellow nicknamed El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How do you come to know him?”</p>

<p>“He was a friend of Vidal’s when we were kids.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he a friend of yours, too?”</p>

<p>“Friend? No. I never had any use for him.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he struck me as a bad one.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“What everybody means; that he was hard-hearted
and that he tortured anybody who was
weaker than himself.”</p>

<p>“Have you a sweetheart?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is she a public woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” stammered Manuel, trembling with
grief and rage.</p>

<p>“What’s her name?”</p>

<p>“Justa.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. She left my house day before
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get to know her?”</p>

<p>“At the home of a ragpicker where I was a
servant.”</p>

<p>“What’s that ragpicker’s name?”</p>

<p>“Señor Custodio.”</p>

<p>“Is it you who are responsible for her being a
prostitute?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not I, sir.”</p>

<p>“When you made her acquaintance, was she already
a public woman?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. When I made her acquaintance she
was a modiste; a man took her away from home;
when I met her for the second time, she was already
on the streets.”</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, Manuel’s voice trembled
and the tears fought to issue from his eyes.</p>

<p>The judge contemplated him coldly.</p>

<p>“Whose suggestion was it to go to the restaurant
near the Sotillo Bridge?”</p>

<p>“Vidal’s.”</p>

<p>“Did you see El Bizco hanging around the restaurant?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t that surprise you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did you know that El Bizco had murdered a
woman on the Aravaca road?”</p>

<p>“Vidal told me.”</p>

<p>“After that crime of El Bizco’s, did you ever
speak to him?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Be very careful of what you say,” and the judge
fixed his stare upon Manuel. “After the death of
that woman, didn’t you ever—not even once—speak
to El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” and Manuel firmly sustained the
judge’s stare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t it strike you as strange that El Bizco
should be hanging around the restaurant?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you let Vidal know?”</p>

<p>“Because my cousin had told me never to mention
El Bizco to him.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because he was afraid of him. I knew this, and
I didn’t want to scare him.”</p>

<p>“When you saw that he was going, why didn’t you
warn him that it might be El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“It never occurred to me.”</p>

<p>“What did you do when you heard Vidal’s outcry?”</p>

<p>“I ran out to the restaurant veranda together with
three women and the Cripple, and from there we
saw Vidal and El Bizco on the little island, fighting.”</p>

<p>“How did you know it was they?”</p>

<p>“From Vidal’s cry, and also because he was wearing
a white Cordovan hat.”</p>

<p>“What time was it when this happened?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say exactly. It was just getting
dark.”</p>

<p>“How did you recognize El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t make him out; I thought it might be
him.”</p>

<p>“Did Vidal have any money on his person?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“How long did the struggle last?”</p>

<p>“A moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t you men have time to run to his assistance?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Very soon after we ran to the balcony,
Vidal fell to the ground, and the other fellow made
for the river and disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Very well. What happened after that?”</p>

<p>“The Cripple and myself hurdled the balustrade,
jumped into the river and ran over to the island.
The Cripple grabbed Vidal’s hand and said, ‘He’s
dead.’ Then we both went back to the restaurant
and left.”</p>

<p>The judge turned to the clerk:</p>

<p>“You will read him this declaration later, and
have him sign it.”</p>

<p>He then rang the bell and the guard appeared.</p>

<p>“He is to continue in solitary.”</p>

<p>Manuel left the office, walking out erect. Several
of the judge’s expressions had cut him to the soul,
but he was satisfied with his deposition; they hadn’t
got him all mixed up.</p>

<p>He returned to the dungeon and stretched out
upon the bench.</p>

<p>“The judge wants to make me out as an accomplice
in the crime. Either that fellow is mighty
stupid or mighty wicked. Well, let’s hope for the
best.”</p>

<p>At noon the dungeon door opened to admit two
men. One was Calatrava; the other, El Garro.</p>

<p>“Hello, kid; I’ve just read in the papers that you
were arrested,” said Calatrava.</p>

<p>“As you see. Here they’ve got me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you made a statement?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What did you say?”</p>

<p>“Say! What did you think I’d say? The
truth.”</p>

<p>“Did you mention my name?”</p>

<p>“I should say so. I mentioned you, the Master
and the whole crowd.”</p>

<p>“The hell you did! What a beast!”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Did you imagine that I was going to
rot here, though I wasn’t in any way to blame, while
the rest of you walked the streets in freedom?”</p>

<p>“You deserve to stick here forever,” exclaimed
Calatrava. “Yes, for being such an idiot and a
squealer.”</p>

<p>Manuel simply shrugged his shoulders. Calatrava
and El Garro exchanged inquiring glances and
then left the dungeon.</p>

<p>Manuel went back to his bench. The afternoon
was half gone when once more the door opened, admitting
the guard. He brought a dish of stew,
some bread, and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>“Who has sent me this?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“A girl named Salvadora.”</p>

<p>The memory suffused Manuel with tenderness,
and since tenderness did not take away his appetite,
he ate his fill and then stretched out on the bench.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>What Happened In the Judge’s Office—The Chapter
House</p>

</div>

<p>Several hours later the judge received three
urgent letters. He opened them, and at once
rang a bell.</p>

<p>“Who brought these letters?” he asked of the
guard.</p>

<p>“A lackey.”</p>

<p>“Is there any plain-clothes man about?”</p>

<p>“There’s El Garro.”</p>

<p>“Send him in.”</p>

<p>The agent entered and came over to the judge’s
desk.</p>

<p>“In these letters,” began the judge, “there is reference
to the deposition just made by that boy
arrested yesterday. How does it come that any one
should have knowledge of his declaration?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Has this boy been speaking with anybody?”</p>

<p>“Nobody,” answered El Garro, calmly.</p>

<p>“In this letter, two ladies whom the minister can
refuse nothing, ask him, and he in turn asks me, to
quash this entire matter. What interest can these
two ladies have in the affair?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. If I knew who they were, perhaps....”</p>

<p>“They are Señora de Braganza and the Marchioness
of Buendía.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then I understand the whole thing. The
proprietors of the Círculo where the boy used to
work are anxious lest he speak of the gambling
house. One of the proprietors is the Colonel’s
wife, who must have gone to see these ladies, and
then the ladies must have had recourse to the
minister.”</p>

<p>“And what’s the connection between the Colonel’s
wife and these ladies?”</p>

<p>“She lends out money. This Señora de Braganza
once forged her husband’s name, and the Colonel’s
wife has the document in her possession.”</p>

<p>“And the marchioness?”</p>

<p>“As to her, that’s another matter. You know
that her most recent lover was Ricardo Salazar.”</p>

<p>“The former deputy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a dyed-in-the-wool rascal. One or two
years ago, when the relations between Ricardo and
the marchioness were still in the early stages, the
marchioness would receive from time to time a letter
which read: ‘I have in my possession a note addressed
by you to your lover, in which you say this
and that (pretty intimate things). If you don’t
come across with a thousand pesetas, I’ll see that
your husband gets that letter.’ She was scared out
of her wits, and paid three, four, five times, until on
the advice of a lady friend, and in agreement with
an officer, they apprehended the man who brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the letters. And it turned out that he was sent by
Ricardo Salazar himself.”</p>

<p>“By the lover?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There’s a gallant cavalier for you!”</p>

<p>“When the marchioness and Ricardo fell
out....”</p>

<p>“On the discovery of this plot with the letter?”</p>

<p>“No. The marchioness forgave him for that.
They had a quarrel because Ricardo asked for
money which the marchioness couldn’t or wouldn’t
give him. Salazar owed three thousand duros to
the Colonel’s wife, and that lady, who is nobody’s
fool, said to him: ‘You hand me over the marchioness’s
letters and we’ll cancel your debt.’
Ricardo handed them over, and ever since that
day the marchioness is bound hand and foot to the
Colonel’s wife and her associates.”</p>

<p>The judge arose from his chair and walked slowly
about the room.</p>

<p>“Then there’s an impersonal note from the
director of <i>El Popular</i>, asking me not to prosecute
this case. What connection can there be between
the gambling den and the owner of that paper?”</p>

<p>“He’s one of the partners. In case the den
should be discovered, the newspaper would start a
strong campaign against the government.”</p>

<p>“How’s a man going to administer justice under
such conditions!” muttered the judge, pensively.</p>

<p>El Garro gazed ironically at the magistrate.</p>

<p>At this moment the telephone bell rang; the ringing
continued for an appreciable while.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>“With your permission?” asked a clerk.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“A message from the minister, asking whether
the case has been disposed of according to his
desires.”</p>

<p>“Yes, tell him yes,” grumbled the judge, ill-humouredly.
Then he turned to the agent. “This
youngster we’ve arrested,—isn’t he in any way involved
in the crime?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely none,” answered El Garro.</p>

<p>“Is he the dead man’s cousin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honour.”</p>

<p>“And he knows El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was a friend of his.”</p>

<p>“Could he help the police in the capture of El
Bizco?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to that part of it. Shall the prisoner
be set free?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We must capture El Bizco. Aren’t his
whereabouts known?”</p>

<p>“He must be in hiding around the suburbs.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any agent who knows the suburban
hangouts well?”</p>

<p>“The best of them is a fellow named Ortiz. If
you will kindly give me a note to the Chief to
place Ortiz under my orders, I’ll guarantee that El
Bizco will be in a cell within a week.”</p>

<p>The judge summoned a clerk, ordered him to
write the letter, and handed it to El Garro.</p>

<p>El Garro left the judge’s office and had Manuel
released from the dungeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Must I make another declaration?” asked the
boy.</p>

<p>“No. You’re to sign the one you made and then
you’re free. Come along, now.”</p>

<p>They went out into the street. At the Court
House entrance Manuel caught sight of La Pea and
La Salvadora; the latter had lost her ordinarily
dour expression.</p>

<p>“Are you free already?” they asked him.</p>

<p>“It looks like it. How did you learn that I’d
been arrested?”</p>

<p>“We read it in the papers,” answered La Fea,
“and she thought of bringing you food.”</p>

<p>“And Jesús?”</p>

<p>“In the hospital.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“His chest ... he’s much better now....
Come right home, won’t you? We live over on
Mellizo Lane, near the Calle de la Arganzuela.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“So long, then.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, and many thanks.”</p>

<p>El Garro and Manuel turned the corner and entering
a portal with a bronze lion on either side,
climbed a short staircase.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“This is the Chapter House.”</p>

<p>They passed along a corridor, between black
screens, into a room where two men sat writing.
El Garro asked for El Gaditano.</p>

<p>“He must be out there,” they informed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>The agent and Manuel continued on their way.
The corridors swarmed with men who were scurrying
to and fro in great haste. Others were motionless,
in quiet attendance. These were ragged
toilers, women garbed in black, sad old ladies bearing
the stamp of poverty,—a frightened, timorous,
humble rout.</p>

<p>The men who were scurrying back and forth
carried letter-files and documents under their arms;
all or almost all of them wore a lofty, proud expression.
There was the judge who strode by in his cap
and black frock coat, gazing indifferently through
his spectacles; there was the clerk, not quite so grave
and more jovial, who would call over some one,
whisper into his ear, go into the office, sign a document
and come out again; there was the young
lawyer who asked how his cases were getting along;
there were the procurator, the attorneys, the clerks,
the office boys.</p>

<p>And here, too, thrusting this drove of humble and
poverty-stricken human cattle toward the shambles
of Justice, appeared the usurer, the policeman,
jewel brokers, moneylenders, landlords....</p>

<p>They all had an understanding with the office boys
and the clerks, who saw to their affairs; these employés
would pigeon-hole troublesome cases, arrange
or embroil a suit and send a fellow to prison
or take him out,—all for a small consideration.</p>

<p>What an admirable machinery! From the lowest
to the highest of these pettifoggers, with or without
a toga, they knew how to exploit the humble, the
poor in spirit, and how to protect the sacred interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of society by seeing to it that the needle on
the balance of justice always inclined toward the
side of wealth....</p>

<p>El Garro found El Gaditano, and asked him:</p>

<p>“Listen, it was you who took down this boy’s
declaration, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, kindly put down that it is not known who
killed his cousin; that it is supposed to be El Bizco,
but that’s all. And then order him released.”</p>

<p>“Very well. Step into the office.”</p>

<p>They passed into a small room with a window
at the rear. Against one of the longer walls was
a closet, on top of which lay a number of articles
involved in recent robberies and seizures, among
them a bicycle.</p>

<p>El Gaditano came in, drew a bundle of documents
from the closet and began to write rapidly.</p>

<p>“ ... That he’s a cousin of the dead man and
that it is supposed that the author of this crime is
a fellow nicknamed El Bizco; isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” corroborated El Garro.</p>

<p>“Very well. Have him sign here.... Now,
here.... That’s all.”</p>

<p>The agent took leave of El Gaditano; Manuel
and El Garro went out into the street.</p>

<p>“Am I free now?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“They’ve set you free on one condition: that you
help in the capture of El Bizco.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a member of the police force.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well, then. Have your choice: either you
help to capture El Bizco or you go back to the
dungeon.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing. I’ll help to capture El Bizco.”</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>La Fea and La Salvadora—Ortiz—Old Friends</p>

</div>

<p>The two men strolled through the Calle del
Barquillo into the Calle de Alcalá.</p>

<p>“They’re not going to catch me again,”
thought Manuel. But at once it occurred to him
that the texture of the law was so stout and close-woven
that it was exceedingly difficult not to be enmeshed
in it, no matter how careful a fellow might
be.</p>

<p>“You haven’t yet told me to whom I owe my
freedom,” exclaimed Manuel.</p>

<p>“To whom you owe your freedom? To me,”
answered El Garro.</p>

<p>Manuel made no comment.</p>

<p>“And now, where are we bound to?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The Campillo del Mundo Nuevo.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got a long journey ahead of us, then.”</p>

<p>“At the Puerta del Sol we’ll take the tram for La
Fuentecilla.”</p>

<p>Which they did. They got off at the end of the
line and proceeded along the Calle de Arganzuela.
At the end of this street, to their right, having
reached the Plaza that constitutes El Campillo del
Mundo Nuevo, they stopped. They passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
a long corridor into a wide patio ringed by galleries.</p>

<p>El Garro walked into the first open door and
asked in a voice of authority:</p>

<p>“Does a police officer by the name of Ortiz live
here?”</p>

<p>Out of the depths of a gloomy corner where two
men were toiling near a furnace, came the answer
from one of them:</p>

<p>“What are you bothering me about? Ask the
janitor.”</p>

<p>The two men were making rolled wafers. Out
of a caldron that was filled with a white pasty mass,
they were extracting ladlefuls and throwing them on
to a pair of boards that closed like nippers. Once
these nippers were closed they placed them in the
fire, heated them on one side, then on the other,
withdrew them, opened them, and on one of the
boards appeared the wafer as round as a seal.
Rapidly the man would roll it up with his finger and
place it in a box.</p>

<p>“So you don’t know whether Ortiz lives here or
not?” asked El Garro again.</p>

<p>“Ortiz?” came a voice out of the black depths,
where nothing was visible. “Yes. He lives here.
He’s the manager of these houses.”</p>

<p>Through the black hole Manuel glimpsed two
men lying on the floor.</p>

<p>“Well, if he’s the manager, he was in the patio a
moment ago.”</p>

<p>El Garro and Manuel went into the courtyard and
the agent caught sight of the captain on the gallery
of the first floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hey, Ortiz!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“What do you want? Who’s calling me?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, Garro.”</p>

<p>The officer hurried down into the patio.</p>

<p>“Hello, there, Señor Garro! What brings you
here?”</p>

<p>“This youngster is a cousin of the fellow that was
killed near the Sotillo Bridge. He knows the
murderer, who’s a cutpurse nicknamed El Bizco.
Do you want to take charge of his capture?”</p>

<p>“Why, man.... If those are the orders....”</p>

<p>“No, the question is, whether you have the time
and want to do it. I have a letter here from the
judge to your colonel, asking that you take charge
of the capture. If you haven’t the time, speak up.”</p>

<p>“There’s time, and to spare.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll leave the letter with your colonel this
very day.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I suppose there’ll be a reward in the
case, eh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that trouble you. Here’s the boy;
don’t let him out of your sight and have him go with
you wherever you go.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“Anything else?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, then, and good luck.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>El Garro left the house; Manuel and Ortiz were
left face to face.</p>

<p>“You’re not to leave my side until we capture El
Bizco. Understand?” said the captain to Manuel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>This Ortiz, noted as a pursuer of gamins and
bandits, was a typical specimen of the criminal. He
had black, clipped moustaches; beetling eyebrows
that met over his flat nose; an upper lip that drew
inwards, revealing his teeth to the very roots; a
narrow forehead with a deep scar in the middle.</p>

<p>He dressed in country fashion, with dark clothes
and a cap. There was something aggressive about
him that recalled a bull dog,—something ferocious
that suggested a wild boar.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to let me out?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“There were some lady friends I had to see.”</p>

<p>“Lady friends don’t count hereabouts. Who are
they? Some street walkers, I’ll bet....”</p>

<p>“No. They’re the sisters of a certain typesetter,
a friend of mine. They were neighbours of mine in
the Santa Casilda hostelry.”</p>

<p>“Ah! So you lived there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I must know them, too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. They’re the sisters of a compositor,
Jesús by name.”</p>

<p>“La Fea?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I know her. Where does she live?”</p>

<p>“Over on Mellizo Lane.”</p>

<p>“It’s right near here. Let’s go to see her.”</p>

<p>They went out. Mellizo Lane was up off the
Calle de la Arganzuela, in the vicinity of the hog
slaughter-house. The whole lane, which at its beginning
was boarded up on both sides and obstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
by huge slabs heaped one upon the other, could boast
but a solitary house of decent size. This was
situated at the end of the alley. Before the house,
in a large yard, some <i>cañis</i> were fussing about with
their mules and donkeys; in the galleries, old gipsies
and young, swart, with shining eyes and gay-hued
raiment, were flitting around.</p>

<p>They asked a gipsy where La Fea lived and he
replied that she would be found at number 6, second
floor.</p>

<p>On the door of the room was a cardboard sign
bearing the announcement: “Machine Sewing.”</p>

<p>They knocked, and a blond youngster appeared.</p>

<p>“This is La Salvadora’s little brother,” said
Manuel.</p>

<p>La Fea came to the door and received Manuel
with joyous effusiveness. She bowed to Ortiz.</p>

<p>“And La Salvadora?” asked Manuel.</p>

<p>“In the kitchen. She’s coming right away.”</p>

<p>It was a bright room, with a window through
which entered the last rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>“This ought to be a very cheery place,” said
Manuel.</p>

<p>“The sun shines here from dawn to sunset,” answered
La Fea. “We’d like to move, but we can’t
find a place like this.”</p>

<p>The room was redolent of peacefulness and industriousness;
there were two new sewing machines,
a pine closet and some flower-pots upon the window
ledge.</p>

<p>“And Jesús is still in hospital?”</p>

<p>“At the San Carlos Clinic,” answered La Fea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not wished to be a burden to the family;
though La Salvadora would have cared for him at
home, he had taken it into his head to go to the hospital.
Fortunately he was now feeling very much
improved and he was soon to be discharged.</p>

<p>At this juncture La Salvadora came in. She
looked very pretty and wore an air of independence.
Greeting Manuel and Ortiz, she sat down before
the machine and began to sew.</p>

<p>“Will you stay with us for supper?” asked La Fea
of Manuel.</p>

<p>“No. I can’t. They won’t let me.”</p>

<p>“If you will promise me,” interjected Ortiz, “that
this man will come to me whenever I send for him,
even at two in the morning, I’ll give him his freedom.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. We give you our word,” declared
La Fea.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. I’ll go. Tomorrow, at nine
in the night, sharp, at my house. Agreed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“With military punctuality!”</p>

<p>“With military punctuality.”</p>

<p>Ortiz then went off, and Manuel was left in the
room with the two seamstresses.</p>

<p>La Salvadora, who adopted a very disdainful
attitude toward Manuel, seemed to feel offence because
he stared at her improved looks with a certain
complacency. Enrique, La Salvadora’s little
brother, was well-developed and very charming; he
played with Manuel and told him, in his childish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
language, a number of things about his sister and
his aunt, as he called La Fea.</p>

<p>After they had had supper, and the child had been
put to bed, they visited the room of an embroiderer
in the neighbourhood, where Manuel found two old
friends of his: Aristas and Aristón.</p>

<p>Aristas had forgotten his gymnastic enthusiasm
and had gone into the distribution of newspapers.</p>

<p>He scurried over half of Madrid leaving the
papers at one place and another. Aristón had
taken his position as a supernumerary. In the
morning Aristas distributed newspapers, distributed
serial issues, distributed prospectuses; in the afternoon
he would paste up posters, and at night he
would go to the theatre. He was extraordinarily
active; he never paused for rest; he organized parties
and dances; on Sundays he gave performances with
an amateur company; he knew by heart the whole of
“Don Juan Tenorio,” “El puñal del godo,” and
other romantic dramas; he had two or three mistresses,
and at every hour of the day and night he
was talking, speechifying, ordering things about
and radiating a wholesome, communicative joy.</p>

<p>Aristón, his necromania somewhat moderated,
worked as a fitter in a factory and received good
wages. Manuel found it very good to be back
again with his friends.</p>

<p>He noticed, or at least thought he noticed, that
Aristón was paying court to La Fea and that he was
for ever calling her Joaquina, which was her real
name. La Fea, finding herself the object of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
attentions, became as a result almost good-looking.</p>

<p>That night Manuel returned to his house on the
Calle de Galileo. La Justa had not yet come back.
Aristas found work for him in a printery on the Carrera
de San Francisco.</p>

<h3 id="III_CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<div class="chapter">

<p>On The Track of El Bizco—The Outskirts—The Ideal of
Jesús</p>

</div>

<p>After spending the day at work in the printing
shop, Manuel reported at nine in the
night at Ortiz’s home.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I like it,” said the chief to him.
“With military punctuality.”</p>

<p>Ortiz armed himself with a revolver, which he
placed in his belt; a stick, which he secured to his
wrist with a thong; a rope. To Manuel he gave a
cudgel, and they left together.</p>

<p>“Let’s make a round of these chop-houses,” said
the guard to Manuel. “And you keep your eye
peeled for El Bizco.”</p>

<p>As they walked up the Calle de Arganzuela they
struck up a conversation.</p>

<p>Ortiz was a member of the police who was genuinely
enamoured of his profession. His father
had belonged to the force before him, and the instinct
of pursuit flowed as strong in their veins as in
the veins of a hunter dog.</p>

<p>According to the tale he told, Ortiz had been a
carbineer on the Málaga coast, eternally at war with
the smugglers, until he came to Madrid and joined
the police department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve done more than any one else of them,” he
declared, “but they don’t promote me because I
haven’t any pull. It was the same way with my
father. He caught more thieves than the whole
police department of Madrid put together, but
nothing doing. He never advanced beyond the
grade of captain. Then they transferred him to
the sewer district and he saw to every squabble
they had down there.... Yet he never carried
a revolver or a stick, like me. Only his blunderbuss.
He was a soldier, he was.”</p>

<p>They happened to be passing a tavern, so they
went in, had a glass of wine, and in the meantime
Manuel scrutinized the men who were gathered
about the tables.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody here that you’re looking for,”
said the tavern-keeper to the policeman.</p>

<p>“I see that there isn’t, Tío Pepe,” answered
Ortiz, extracting some coins from his pocket to pay
for the drinks.</p>

<p>“My treat,” said the man behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>They left the tavern and reached the Plaza de la
Cebada.</p>

<p>“Let’s go over to the Café de Naranjeros,” suggested
the captain. “Though it’s not likely that
our bird is flying thereabouts. Still, often where
you least expect....”</p>

<p>They entered the café; there were only a few men
chatting with the singers. From the doorway
Ortiz shouted in:</p>

<p>“Hey, Tripulante, can I see you for a second?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>A young man who looked as if he came from good
family arose and came over to Ortiz.</p>

<p>“Do you know a thug called El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe I do.”</p>

<p>“Does he hang around this district?”</p>

<p>“No, not hereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>“He really doesn’t. He must be down below.
You can take my word for that.”</p>

<p>“I do, man. Why not? Listen, Tripulante,”
added Ortiz, seizing the youth by the arm.
“Watch out, eh? You’ll slip, if you don’t.”</p>

<p>Tripulante burst into laughter, and placing the
index finger of his right hand upon his lower eyelash,
he whispered:</p>

<p>“On the track!... And mum’s the word,
comrade!”</p>

<p>“Very well. Keep your eyes open just the same,
in case he shows up. Remember we know you.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me, señor Ortiz,” replied the
youth. “I’ll keep a sharp watch.”</p>

<p>The officer and Manuel left the café.</p>

<p>“He’s a slippery article, as clever as any crook.
Let’s go further down. Perhaps El Tripulante is
right.”</p>

<p>They reached the Ronda de Toledo. The night
was beautiful, atwinkle with stars. Afar, some
bonfires lighted the sky. Out of the chimney of the
Gas House belched a huge black swirl of smoke, like
the powerful exhalation of some monster. They
sauntered along the Calle del Gas, which, as if to
provide a contrast to its name, was illuminated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
oil-lamps; skirting the Casa Blanca they descended
to Las Injurias. They crossed a narrow street and
fairly stumbled against the night watchman.</p>

<p>Ortiz told him what mission brought them
there; he gave him a description of El Bizco.
The sereno, however, informed them that nobody
answering to that description was to be found in
that vicinity.</p>

<p>“We can make inquiries, if you gentlemen wish.”</p>

<p>The three penetrated a narrow passageway that
led to a mud-strewn patio.</p>

<p>There was a light in the window of one of the
houses, and they drew near to reconnoitre. By the
illumination of a candle stub that was placed upon
a kitchen shelf they made out a tattered old woman
squatting on the floor. At her side, blanketed with
rags, slept two boys and a little girl.</p>

<p>They left the patio and walked down an alley.</p>

<p>“There’s a family here that I don’t know,” said
the sereno, and he knocked at the door with the tip
of his pike. There was a delay in opening.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked a woman’s voice from within.</p>

<p>“The law,” answered Ortiz.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a woman in tatters,
with nothing underneath. The watchman walked
straight in, followed by Manuel and Ortiz; the place
was filled with an atrocious, overpowering stench.
Upon a wretched bed improvised out of shreds and
paper refuse lay a blind woman. The sereno thrust
his pike under the bed.</p>

<p>“You can see for yourselves. He isn’t here.”</p>

<p>Ortiz and Manuel left the Las Injurias district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“El Bizco lived over in Las Cambroneras for a
time,” suggested Manuel.</p>

<p>“Then there isn’t much use in looking for him
there,” replied Ortiz. “But no matter. Heave,
ho, my lads! Let’s try it, anyway.”</p>

<p>They strolled along the Paseo de Yeserías. On
both sides of the Toledo Bridge gleamed the gas-lamps;
here and there a narrow ribbon of the river
sent back reflections from its dark waters. From
the direction of Madrid, out of the Gas House chimneys
issued red flames like dragons of fire. From
the distance came the whistle of a locomotive; along
the banks of the Canal the silhouettes of the trees
writhed upward into the gloom of the night.</p>

<p>They found the sereno of Las Cambroneras and
asked after El Bizco.</p>

<p>“I’ll talk tomorrow with Paco el Cañí and find
out. Where shall we meet tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“In La Blasa’s tavern.”</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll be there at three.”</p>

<p>They crossed the bridge once more and went
into Casa Blanca.</p>

<p>“We’ll see the administrator,” said Ortiz. They
entered a causeway; to one side, they knocked at a
place the half-opened door of which showed a chink
of light. A man in shirt-sleeves came out.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” he shouted.</p>

<p>Ortiz gave his credentials.</p>

<p>“No such chap is around here,” answered the
caretaker. “I’m positive as to that; I have every
one of my tenants listed in this notebook, and I know
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Casa Blanca, Ortiz and Manuel made
for Las Peñuelas, where Ortiz had a long conversation
with the sereno. Then they visited a number
of the taverns in the neighbourhood; the places
were filled with customers, though the doors were
closed.</p>

<p>As they went through the Calle del Ferrocarril,
the sereno pointed out the spot where they had discovered
the quartered body of the woman in a sack.
Ortiz and the watchman discussed this and other
crimes that had been committed in the vicinity, then
they separated.</p>

<p>“That watchman is a corker,” said Ortiz. “He’s
cudgelled every bully and thug out of Las Peñuelas.”</p>

<p>It was already late when they had left the taverns,
and Ortiz thought that they might postpone their
hunt to the next day. He remained in the Campillo
del Mundo Nuevo and Manuel, tramping
across half of Madrid, returned to his house.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he went to work at the
printery, but when he told them that he could not
come that afternoon, he was discharged.</p>

<p>Manuel went to La Fea’s for a bite.</p>

<p>“They’ve fired me from the printing shop,” he
announced, upon entering.</p>

<p>“You must have come in late,” snapped La Salvadora.</p>

<p>“No. Ortiz told me yesterday that I’d have to
go along with him this afternoon; I told them so at
the printery and they fired me on the spot.”</p>

<p>La Salvadora smiled with sarcastic incredulousness,
and Manuel felt his cheeks turning red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“You needn’t believe it if you don’t want to, but
that’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said a word, have I, man?” retorted
La Salvadora, mockingly.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t, but you were laughing at
me.”</p>

<p>Manuel left La Fea’s in a huff, sought out Ortiz,
and together they made their way to Las Injurias.</p>

<p>It was a mild afternoon and the sun was glorious.
They took chairs just outside La Blasa’s tavern.
In a lane opposite to them the men were sprawling
in the doorways of their houses; the women, with
their ragged skirts gathered about them, were skipping
from one side to the other, their feet splashing
in the stinking sewage that ran like a black stream
through the middle of the street. Here and there
a woman had a cigarette in her mouth. Big grey
rats darted about over the mud, pursued by a number
of gamins with sticks and stones.</p>

<p>Ortiz exchanged a few words with the proprietress
of the resort and shortly afterward the sereno
of the Cambroneras district appeared. He saluted
Ortiz, they drained a few glasses, and then the
sereno said:</p>

<p>“I had a talk with Paco el Cañí. He knows El
Bizco. He says the fellow’s not hereabouts. He
believes he must be in La Manigua, or California,
or some place of the sort.”</p>

<p>“Quite possible. Very well, gentlemen, see you
later.” And Ortiz got up, followed by Manuel.
They walked up to the square at the Toledo Bridge,
crossed over the Manzanares river and set out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
the Andalucía cart-road. A few days before,
Manuel had gone there for lunch with Vidal and
Calatrava. There were the same gangs of thugs in
the doorways of the restaurants; some knew Ortiz
and invited him to a glass.</p>

<p>They reached a district bordering the river,—a
heap of wretched hovels, without chimneys, without
windows, with wattled roofs. Clouds of mosquitos
hovered above the grass on the banks.</p>

<p>“This is El Tejar de Mata Pobre,” said Ortiz.</p>

<p>These miserable shacks housed some ragpickers
and their families. All the denizens of the poverty-ridden
settlement,—a dirty, yellowish crew they
made,—were consumed by fevers, whose germs
thrived in the black, muddy waters of the river.
Nobody there had ever heard of El Bizco. Manuel
and Ortiz went on. At a short distance from this
spot appeared another, upon a rise in the ground,
composed of huts and their poultry-yards.</p>

<p>“The Tinsmiths’ quarter,—that’s what this is
called,” informed Ortiz.</p>

<p>It was like a village reared upon dung and straw.
Each of the houses, built of all manner of débris and
offal, had its yard, delimited by fences made of old,
rusty cans flattened out and nailed against posts.
Here, urban poverty blended with the poverty of
the country; upon the ground of the yards the old
baskets and the cardboard hat boxes rubbed against
the notched sickle and the rake. Some of the houses
gave the impression of relative comfort; these had
a look of industriousness about them. Heaps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
straw were piled up in their yards and hens scratched
the soil.</p>

<p>Ortiz approached a man who was repairing a cart.</p>

<p>“Listen, friend. Do you happen to know a chap
named El Bizco? A red, ugly....”</p>

<p>“Are you from the police?” asked the man.</p>

<p>“No. Oh, no, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you look as if you were. But that’s your
affair. I don’t know this Bizco,” and the man
turned his back upon them.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to have a care around here,” whispered
Ortiz. “If they ever find out what we’ve
come for, we’ll get a drubbing that we’ll remember.”</p>

<p>They left the Tinsmiths’ quarter, crossed the river
by a bridge over which the railroad ran, and continued
along the banks of the Manzanares.</p>

<p>On the meadows by the stream, which were
dazzling with verdure, the cows were at pasture.
Some ragged figures were walking slowly, cautiously
along, hunting crickets.</p>

<p>Manuel and Ortiz reached some country houses
called La China; the officer made inquiries of a
gardener. The man did not know El Bizco.</p>

<p>Leaving this place, they sat down upon the grass
to rest. It was growing dark; Madrid, a reddish
yellow, with its spires and domes, aglow with the
last quivering rays of the setting sun, rose out of
the distance. The glass panes of the Observatory
flashed flame. A huge ball of copper, on the top
of some edifice, beamed like a sun over the grimy
roofs; here and there a star was already shining in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the Prussian blue arch of heaven; the Guadarrama
range, dark violet in the dusk, broke the distant
horizon with its whitish peaks.</p>

<p>Ortiz and Manuel hastened back to the city. By
the time they had reached the Paseo de Embajadores,
it was night; they had a glass at the Manigua
restaurant and kept their eyes open in the meantime.</p>

<p>“Have supper with me,” suggested Ortiz. “Tonight
we’ll resume the hunt. We’ve got to ransack
all Madrid.”</p>

<p>Manuel had supper with the officer and his family
in the house at El Campillo del Mundo Nuevo.
Thereupon they visited nearly every tavern on the
Calle del Mesón de Paredes and the Calle de Embajadores,
afterward going into the little café on the
Calle de la Esgrima. The whole place was
thronged with vagabonds; as the officer and Manuel
took their seats, the news was quickly spread from
one customer to the other. A boy who sat at a
nearby table showing a ring and a comb made haste
to conceal them as soon as he caught sight of Ortiz.
The officer noticed this move and called to the
boy.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked the youngster, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I want to ask you something.”</p>

<p>“Speak up, then.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a chap called El Bizco?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>Ortiz then asked the youth a number of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
questions; he must have been convinced that the boy
did not know El Bizco, for he muttered:</p>

<p>“Nobody knows where he is.”</p>

<p>They went into one tavern after the other. As
they were walking through the Calle del Amparo,
Ortiz made up his mind to search a lodging house
that had a red lantern hanging from one of its balconies.</p>

<p>They went in and climbed a plank stairway with
wobbly steps, lit by a lantern embedded in a wall.
On the first floor were rooms for assignations; on
the second was the public dormitory. Ortiz pulled
the bell wire and a repulsive hag answered the summons
with a candle in her hand, a white kerchief on
her head and in battered shoes; this was the woman
in charge.</p>

<p>“We belong to the police and we want to look
this place over. With your kind permission, we’ll
step in.”</p>

<p>The woman shrugged her shoulders and made
way for them to enter.</p>

<p>They passed through a short corridor which ended
in a long, narrow room, with low wooden platforms
on either side and two rows of beds. Over the
centre hung an oil-lamp that hardly illuminated the
spacious hall. The floor, which was of brick,
twisted to one side.</p>

<p>Ortiz asked for the candle and went along the
row of beds, shedding its light upon each successive
face.</p>

<p>Some were snoring outrageously; others, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
awake, permitted themselves to be peered at. The
bedsheets revealed bare shoulders, herculean chests,
the sunken thorax of sickly folk....</p>

<p>“Is there anybody downstairs?” asked Ortiz of
the matron.</p>

<p>“Not on the first floor. There must be somebody
in the rooms off the vestibule.”</p>

<p>They went down to the entrance. A door led to
a damp cellar. In a corner lay a beggar asleep in
his shreds and patches.</p>

<p class="tb">On the day following this expedition, Manuel,
returning in the afternoon to La Fea’s, found Jesús
sitting down and chatting with his sister and La
Salvadora.</p>

<p>At sight of him Manuel was overcome by a certain
emotion. The lad was still very weak and pale.
The two youths examined each other closely, and
chatted about the life they had led since their
last meeting. Then they passed to present affairs,
and Manuel explained his situation and the duties
that bound him to Ortiz.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. They’ve told me all about it already,”
said Jesús. “But I refused to believe it.
So they let you go free on condition that you’d help
capture El Bizco? And you agreed?”</p>

<p>“Yes. If I hadn’t they’d have kept me locked
up. What was I to do?”</p>

<p>“Refuse.”</p>

<p>“And rot in prison?”</p>

<p>“And rot in prison, rather than play a friend
such a scurvy trick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>“El Bizco is no friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“But he was, from what you say....”</p>

<p>“Friend? No....”</p>

<p>“Then a comrade in your loafing days.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve become a member of the police?”</p>

<p>“Man!... Besides, the victim was my cousin,
remember.”</p>

<p>“A fine man you are for anybody to rely on!”
added the compositor sarcastically.</p>

<p>Manuel was silent. He believed that he had
done ill to purchase his freedom at such a price. El
Bizco was a bandit; but the fellow had never done
him any harm. That was true.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is, I can’t turn back,” said
Manuel. “Nor can I escape, for that Ortiz would
come here and it would be just like him to take off
your sister and La Salvadora to prison.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because they told him they’d be responsible
for me.”</p>

<p>“Bah, that’s easy to get around! They tell him
that you were here; that they warned you not to
forget to do the same as on other days, and that
that’s all they know. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“What do you think of the plan?” asked Manuel
of La Fea, vacillating.</p>

<p>“Do as you please. I think Jesús must know
what he’s talking about, and I don’t think they can
do anything to us.”</p>

<p>“There’s another thing,” added Manuel. “I
can’t live for a very long time in hiding. I’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
to work so as to get food, and they’ll catch me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to a printing shop I know,”
answered Jesús.</p>

<p>“But they might suspect. No, no.”</p>

<p>“Then you prefer to be an informer?”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I’m going to do right away:
I’m going this very moment to see somebody who
can fix the whole business.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>“No, no. Let me alone.”</p>

<p>Manuel left with the resolution to speak with
the Cripple and the Master. He hurried over to
the Círculo. He was admitted, ran to the first
flight, and said to the man who was stationed at
the door to the gambling room:</p>

<p>“The Master? Is he in his office?”</p>

<p>“No, Don Marcos is there.”</p>

<p>Manuel knocked at the door and walked in.
Calatrava was at a desk together with an employee,
counting white and red chips. At sight of Manuel,
Marcos turned an icy stare upon him.</p>

<p>“What have you come here for? Squealer!” he
cried. “You’re not wanted here.”</p>

<p>“I know that.”</p>

<p>“You’re fired. And you needn’t expect any back
pay, either.”</p>

<p>“No. I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you want?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. El Garro, your police friend, let
me go free on condition that I’d help in the capture
of the man who killed Vidal, and they keep me going
and coming at all hours of the day and night. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
sick and tired of it all, and I don’t want to become
a stool-pigeon.”</p>

<p>“Well, what has all this got to do with me?”</p>

<p>“What’s more, if I don’t show up at the house of
the captain under whose order El Garro placed me,
they’ll arrest me and take me off to jail.”</p>

<p>“Good enough. You’ll learn there not to wag
your tongue so freely.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. What I’ll do there is tell them
just how folks are cheated in this establishment....”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy. You’re sucking around for a
couple of drubbings.”</p>

<p>“No. I want you to tell El Garro that I don’t
care to be chasing El Bizco around. What’s more,
I want you to tell him to quit hounding me. Now
you know just what to do.”</p>

<p>“What I’m going to do is give you a couple of
kicks this very minute, you informer!”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that.”</p>

<p>The Cripple lurched over to Manuel with his
closed fist and aimed a blow at him; but Manuel
was agile enough to seize him by the arm, shove
him backwards, make him lose his balance and send
him falling across the table, which was overturned
with a formidable crash. Calatrava regained his
feet; he was in a fury and made for Manuel once
more; but the noise had brought some men, who
separated them. It was at this juncture that the
Master appeared in the doorway of the office.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” he asked, eyeing Calatrava
and Manuel severely. “You fellows get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
here,” he ordered, turning to the spectators.</p>

<p>The three were left alone, and Manuel explained
the reason of the squabble.</p>

<p>The Master, after hearing the story, turned to
Calatrava.</p>

<p>“Is all this he’s been telling you true?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But he came here with demands and
threats....”</p>

<p>“Very well. We won’t discuss that.” Then
addressing himself to Manuel. “So you don’t want
to help the police? You’re right. You may go.
I’ll tell El Garro not to bother you.”</p>

<p>An hour later, Manuel and Jesús had left the
house for a walk. It was a stifling hot night; they
went towards the Ronda.</p>

<p>They chatted. Manuel was filled with a gnawing
irritation against the whole world,—a hatred that
up to then had lain dormant was now awaking in
his soul against society, against mankind....</p>

<p>“Let me tell you,” he concluded, “and I mean
it. I wish it would rain dynamite for a whole week
and that then the Eternal Father himself would fall
from heaven, a heap of ashes.”</p>

<p>In his fury he invoked every destructive power,
that this miserable society of ours might be reduced
to a mound of smouldering ruins.</p>

<p>Jesús listened attentively to his diatribe.</p>

<p>“You’re an anarchist,” he said.</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m one, too.”</p>

<p>“You?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“Ever since I’ve seen the infamies committed in
the world; ever since I’ve seen how coldly a piece
of humanity is given over to death; ever since I’ve
seen how men die friendless on the streets and
in the hospital,” answered Jesús with a certain
solemnity.</p>

<p>Manuel was silent. Mutely the two friends
sauntered along the Ronda de Segovia, selecting a
bench in the gardens of La Virgen del Puerto.</p>

<p>The heavens over them were studded with stars;
the milky way lay white across the immense blue
vault. The geometric figure of the Great Bear
shone high up in the sky. Arcturus and Vega
glowed softly in that ocean of planets.</p>

<p>Far off, the dark fields, furrowed by lines of
lights, looked like the water of a harbour; the rows
of lights seemed like the piers of a wharf.</p>

<p>The damp, warm air was saturated with the
scents of wild plants—odours set free by the heat.</p>

<p>“How many stars!” exclaimed Manuel. “What
can they be?”</p>

<p>“They’re worlds and worlds without end.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why it soothes me so to see the
sky so beautiful. Listen, Jesús. Do you believe
that there are people in those worlds yonder?” asked
Manuel.</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Why not?”</p>

<p>“And prisons, too, judges, gambling houses and
police?... Hey? Do you?”</p>

<p>Jesús did not answer the question. Then, in a
calm voice he spoke of a vision of an idyllic humanity,—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
sweet, pious, noble and childishly simple
vision.</p>

<p>In this dream, Man, guided by a new idea, attained
to a superior state.</p>

<p>No more hatred, no more rancour. No more
judges, nor policemen, nor soldiers, nor authority,
nor fatherland. In the vast prairies of the world,
free men laboured in the sunlight. The law of love
has supplanted the law of duty, and the horizon of
humanity becomes ever wider, ever a softer
blue....</p>

<p>And Jesús continued speaking of a vague ideal of
love and justice, of industry and piety. These
words of his, chaotic, incoherent as they were, fell
like a solacing balm upon Manuel’s lacerated
heart.... Then the two lapsed into a long silence,
immersed in their own thoughts, contemplating
the night.</p>

<p>The heavens were aglow with an august beatitude,
and the vague sensation of the immensity of
space, the infinitude of these imponderable
worlds, spread a delicious tranquillity over their
hearts....</p>
